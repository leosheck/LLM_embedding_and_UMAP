      " Cognitive bias evaluation on the choice of treatment in common retinal disorders among retina specialists in 2023.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The study aimed to discern the intent to treat with the therapeutic agents prescribed first or second line in the following eye conditions: neovascular age-related macular Degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and myopic maculopathy with choroidal neovascularization (MMNV). The study also aimed to distinguish the ophthalmologists' intended treatment for their patients from those that they would prescribe for themselves if they were affected by the above macular conditions.\n",
      "METHODS: The study utilized an online survey of 243 French ophthalmologists practicing medical retina, with males accounting for 54.3% of the participants. Data was obtained using a questionnaire that focused on the ophthalmologists' experience with various agents as well as their first and second line choices for nAMD, DME, RVO, and MMNV.\n",
      "RESULTS: The vast majority of French ophthalmologists (99%) had experience with the most widely used anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs); ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept. Fewer than 8% reported experience with anti-VEGF drug reservoirs, biosimilars, or faricimab. The study findings also showed ranibizumab and aflibercept as the commonly prescribed first line choices for the above-mentioned ocular conditions. For the second line choice, the study showed that aflibercept and dexamethasone intravitreal implants were the most common across the four retinal conditions studied. The only difference in intent to treat for \"patients\" versus \"yourself\" was for biosimilars (0% to 0.8%, P=0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The findings regarding the first and second line choices for the mentioned ocular disorders were found to agree with the findings of published literature currently used in practice, with a tendency to prefer ranibizumab as first line therapy for neovascular disorders and aflibercept as first line therapy for macular edema. In addition, there were no differences between choices for first and second line therapy for patients vs. ophthalmologists.\n"

      " Effects and potential mechanisms of exercise and physical activity on eye health and ocular diseases.\n",
      "In the field of eye health, the profound impact of exercise and physical activity on various ocular diseases has become a focal point of attention. This review summarizes and elucidates the positive effects of exercise and physical activities on common ocular diseases, including dry eye disease (DED), cataracts, myopia, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It also catalogues and offers exercise recommendations based on the varying impacts that different types and intensities of physical activities may have on specific eye conditions. Beyond correlations, this review also compiles potential mechanisms through which exercise and physical activity beneficially affect eye health. From mitigating ocular oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, reducing intraocular pressure, enhancing mitochondrial function, to promoting ocular blood circulation and the release of protective factors, the complex biological effects triggered by exercise and physical activities reveal their substantial potential in preventing and even assisting in the treatment of ocular diseases. This review aims not only to foster awareness and appreciation for how exercise and physical activity can improve eye health but also to serve as a catalyst for further exploration into the specific mechanisms and key targets through which exercise impacts ocular health. Such inquiries are crucial for advancing innovative strategies for the treatment of eye diseases, thereby holding significant implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches.\n",

      " Factors associated with pathologic myopia onset and progression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To synthesise evidence across studies on factors associated with pathologic myopia (PM) onset and progression based on the META-analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification framework.\n",
      "METHODS: Findings from six longitudinal studies (5-18 years) were narratively synthesised and meta-analysed, using odds ratio (OR) as the common measure of association. All studies adjusted for baseline myopia, age and sex at a minimum. The quality of evidence was rated using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.\n",
      "RESULTS: Five out of six studies were conducted in Asia. There was inconclusive evidence of an independent effect (or lack thereof) of ethnicity and sex on PM onset/progression. The odds of PM onset increased with greater axial length (pooled OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.71-2.40; p < 0.001), older age (pooled OR: 1.07; 1.05-1.09; p < 0.001) and more negative spherical equivalent refraction, SER (OR: 0.77; 0.68-0.87; p < 0.001), all of which were supported by an acceptable level of evidence. Fundus tessellation was found to independently increase the odds of PM onset in a population-based study (OR: 3.02; 2.58-3.53; p < 0.001), although this was only supported by weak evidence. There was acceptable evidence that greater axial length (pooled OR: 1.23; 1.09-1.39; p < 0.001), more negative SER (pooled OR: 0.87; 0.83-0.92; p < 0.001) and higher education level (pooled OR: 3.17; 1.36-7.35; p < 0.01) increased the odds of PM progression. Other baseline factors found to be associated with PM progression but currently supported by weak evidence included age (pooled OR: 1.01), severity of myopic maculopathy (OR: 3.61), intraocular pressure (OR: 1.62) and hypertension (OR: 0.21).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Most PM risk/prognostic factors are not supported by an adequate evidence base at present (an indication that PM remains understudied). Current factors for which an acceptable level of evidence exists (limited in number) are unmodifiable in adults and lack personalised information. More longitudinal studies focusing on uncovering modifiable factors and imaging biomarkers are warranted.\n"

We investigated the association between very severe periodontitis and early biomarkers of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in individuals with no eye disease.\n",
      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the prospective community-based cohort United Kingdom (UK) Biobank.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven thousand three hundred eleven UK residents aged 40 to 70 years recruited between 2006 and 2010 underwent retinal imaging.\n",
      "METHODS: Macular-centered OCT images acquired at the baseline visit were segmented for retinal sublayer thicknesses. Very severe periodontitis was ascertained through a touchscreen questionnaire.

Assessable fundus images were available for 930 (60.9%) individuals (mean age, 88.6 ± 2.7 years). MMD was defined by macular patchy atrophies (i.e., MMD stage 3 and 4 as defined by the Pathologic Myopia Study Group).\n",
      "RESULTS: MMD prevalence was 21 of 930 (2.3%; 95% CI, 1.3-3.3), with 10 individuals (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.4-1.7) having MMD stage 3 and 11 participants (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.5-1.9) MMD stage 4 disease. Within MMD stage 3 and 4, prevalence of binocular moderate to severe vision impairment was 4 of 10 (40%; 95% CI, 31-77) and 7 of 11 (64%; 95% CI, 30-98), respectively, and the prevalence of binocular blindness was 2 of 10 (20%; 95% CI, 0-50) and 3 of 11 (27%; 95% CI, 0-59), respectively. In minor myopia (axial length, 24.0 to <24.5 mm), moderate myopia (axial length, 24.5 to <26.5 mm), and high myopia (axial length, ≥26.5 mm), MMD prevalence in the right eyes was 0 of 46 eyes (0%), 3 of 40 eyes (8%; 95% CI, 0-16), and 7 of 9 (78%; 95% CI, 44-100), respectively; MMD prevalence in the left eyes was 1 in 48 eyes (2%; 95% CI, 0-6), 4 of 36 eyes (11%; 95% CI, 0-22), and 3 of 4 eyes (75%; 95% CI, 0-100), respectively. In multivariable analysis, a higher MMD prevalence (odds ratio, 8.89; 95% CI, 3.43-23.0; P < 0.001) and higher MMD stage (beta, 0.45; B, 19; 95% CI, 0.16-0.22; P < 0.001) were correlated with longer axial length but not with any other ocular or systemic parameter.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: MMD prevalence (stages 3 and 4) in very old individuals increased 8.89-fold for each mm axial length increase, with a prevalence of ≥75% in highly myopic eyes. In old age, highly myopic individuals have a high risk of eventually developing MMD with marked vision impairment.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is used for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Patchy chorioretinal atrophy (pCRA) enlargement has been reported in mCNV cases associated with vision loss. Our aim was to compare the long-term effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy alone versus anti-VEGF followed by posterior scleral reinforcement (PSR) in controlling myopic maculopathy in mCNV eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of 95 high myopia patients (refractive error ≥ 6.00 diopters, axial length ≥ 26.0 mm) with mCNV. Patients were treated with anti-VEGF alone (group A) or anti-VEGF followed by PSR (group B). The following data were collected: refractive error, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ophthalmic fundus examination, ocular coherence tomography and ocular biometry at 12 and 24 months pre- and postoperatively. The primary outcomes were changes in pCRA and BCVA.\n",

      "An 80-year-old woman presented with painless blurring of vision and monocular diplopia in her left eye following routine phacoemulsification and monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation 5 weeks earlier. Her uncorrected visual acuity (VA) was 6/60 correctable with pinhole to 6/21. Her best-corrected VA was 6/15 with a subjective refraction of -0.50DS/-5.25DCx37. Her corneal astigmatism was -1.25DCx74. Ophthalmic examination disclosed a severely tilted single-piece posterior chamber IOL in the capsular bag. The inferior portion of the optic was tilted posteriorly because of a twisted and malpositioned haptic. The patient underwent remedial surgery to untwist and reposition the IOL haptic which led to immediate improvement of the IOL position. Her uncorrected VA improved to 6/12\n"

Myopic traction maculopathy encompasses epiretinal membrane, foveoschisis, macular hole, and macular hole-related retinal detachment. It is recommended to perform vitrectomy combined with inner limiting membrane peeling for Type II epiretinal membrane, foveal-sparing inner limiting membrane peeling for foveoschisis, inverted inner limiting membrane flap technique for macular hole, and vitrectomy combined with macular buckle for refractory macular hole-related retinal detachment. Myopic traction maculopathy is a chronically progressive condition, and surgeons need to accurately determine the timing of surgery and choose appropriate procedures to maximize the benefits for patients.\n",

      " Relationship between automated choroidal thickness measurements and retinal sensitivity using microperimetry in patients with myopia and different stages of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between macular choroidal thickness (CT) measurements and retinal sensitivity (RS) in eyes with myopia and different stages of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: A masked, cross-sectional, and consecutive study involving patients with emmetropia/myopia (control group) and high myopia (HM) eyes. Automated choroidal thickness (CT) and manual outer retinal layer (ORL) thickness were acquired using swept-source optical coherence tomography, while retinal sensitivity (RS) assessed by microperimetry (MP3) in all regions of the macular Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid. Comparisons were made between groups, and correlations were performed among these measurements, demographic and ocular parameters and myopic maculopathy classification.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 37 (74 eyes) patients were included in the study. The mean age was 39 ± 13 years, and 28 patients (76%) were female. HM eyes exhibited inferior best-corrected visual acuity and a more advanced myopic maculopathy classification compared to the control group. The mean macular CT were 255 and 179 μm in the control and HM eyes (P < 0.001), respectively. In the HM eyes, superior ETDRS region presented the greatest values. Mean RS in control and HM groups was 28 and 24 dB (P = 0.001), respectively. Inner temporal followed by superior, were the regions of higher RS. Mean ORL thickness was 83 and 79 μm (P < 0.001), in the control and HM groups, respectively. The inner temporal ETDRS region presented the thickest measure. CT correlated significantly with RS (r = 0.41, P < 0.001) and ORL thickness, (r = 0.58, P < 0.001), which also correlated with RS (r = 0.40, P < 0.001). Spherical equivalent, axial length and myopic maculopathy stage were the parameters that most correlated with CT, RS and ORL thickness. For every 100 μm increase in thickening of CT there was an average increase of 3.4 μm in ORL thickness and 2.7 dB in RS. Myopic maculopathy classification demonstrated influence only with CT.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Myopia degree is related to ORL and choroidal thinning and deterioration of retinal sensitivity in some ETDRS regions of the macula. Choroidal thinning is associated to with a decline of retinal sensitivity, thinning of ORL, and worsening of myopic maculopathy classification, so new treatments are necessary to prevent myopia progression.\n"

      " Evaluation of macular atrophy in patients treated with macular buckle for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM): mid and long-term follow-up.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence, rate and pattern of progression of myopic maculopathy in eyes operated with macular buckle (MB) for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) vs a control group without surgery to find out if the progression varies due to the macular buckle's indentation, and to evaluate possible MB-related pigmentary changes or atrophy.\n",
      "METHODS: Eyes operated with macular buckle with two good quality fundus images: one preoperative or early postoperative image and the second image of at least 12 months apart, the control group was comprised by the contralateral eyes. Demographics, axial length, follow-up, stage of MTM and myopic maculopathy were reported. Groups and subgroups (mid and long-term follow-up) progression results were reported and compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included 116 eyes of 66 patients. Progression was found in 29 eyes (41.4%) and 23 eyes (50%) in the macular buckle group and control group, respectively. The progression rate was 73 per 1000 eye-years and 88.9 per 1000 eye-years in the macular buckle group and the control group, respectively. Axial length was found a predictor of progression (OR,2.59; p=0.02).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Progression of myopic maculopathy was similar in both groups, even mildly grater in the control group. We did not find any MB-related pigmentary changes or atrophy.\n",

      " Polarization-Sensitive OCT Imaging of Scleral Abnormalities in Eyes With High Myopia and Dome-Shaped Macula.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: The relevance of visualizing scleral fiber orientation may offer insights into the pathogenesis of pathologic myopia, including dome-shaped maculopathy (DSM).\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the orientation and density of scleral collagen fibers in highly myopic eyes with and without DSM by polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT).\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series included patients with highly myopic eyes (defined as a refractive error ≥6 diopters or an axial length ≥26.5 mm) with and without a DSM examined at a single site in May and June 2019. Analysis was performed from September 2019 to October 2023.\n",
      "EXPOSURES: The PS-OCT was used to study the birefringence and optic axis of the scleral collagen fibers.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The orientation and optic axis of scleral fibers in inner and outer layers of highly myopic eyes were assessed, and the results were compared between eyes with and without a DSM.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 72 patients (51 [70.8%] female; mean [SD] age, 61.5 [12.8] years) were included, and 89 highly myopic eyes were examined (mean [SD] axial length, 30.4 [1.7] mm); 52 (58.4%) did not have a DSM and 37 (41.6%) had a DSM (10 bidirectional [27.0%] and 27 horizontal [73.0%]). Among the 52 eyes without DSM, the 13 eyes with simple high myopia had primarily inner sclera visible, displaying radially oriented fibers in optic axis images. In contrast, the entire thickness of the sclera was visible in 39 eyes with pathologic myopia. In these eyes, the optic axis images showed vertically oriented fibers within the outer sclera. Eyes presenting with both horizontal and bidirectional DSMs had clusters of fibers with low birefringence at the site of the DSM. In the optic axis images, horizontally or obliquely oriented scleral fibers were aggregated in the inner layer at the DSM. The vertical fibers located posterior to the inner fiber aggregation were not thickened and appeared thin compared with the surrounding areas.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study using PS-OCT revealed inner scleral fiber aggregation without outer scleral thickening at the site of the DSM in highly myopic eyes. Given the common occurrence of scleral pathologies, such as DSM, and staphylomas in eyes with pathologic myopia, recognizing these fiber patterns could be important. These insights may be relevant to developing targeted therapies to address scleral abnormalities early and, thus, mitigate potential damage to the overlying neural tissue.\n"

      " Novel surgical approaches for treating myopic traction maculopathy: a meta-analysis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) is a complication of pathological myopia and encompasses various pathological conditions caused by tractional changes in the eye. These changes include retinoschisis, foveal retinal detachment, and lamellar or full-thickness macular holes (FTMHs). This meta-analysis evaluated the safety and efficacy of novel surgical for treating MTM.\n",
      "METHODS: To compare the outcomes of different surgical approaches for MTM, multiple databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Meta-Register of Controlled Trials, were comprehensively searched. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.1.\n",
      "RESULTS: Nine comparative studies involving 350 eyes were included in this meta-analysis. There were significant differences between fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane peeling (FSIP) and standard internal limiting membrane peeling (ILMP). Preoperative best-corrected visual acuity BCVA (standard mean difference (SMD): -0.10, 95% CI: -0.32 to 0.12) and central foveal thickness CFT (SMD: 0.05, 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.33) were not significantly different (p = 0.39 and p = 0.71, respectively). However, the postoperative BCVA improved significantly (SMD = - 0.47, 95% CI: - 0.80, - 0.14, p = 0.006) in the FSIP group compared to the standard ILMP group. Postoperative CFT did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.62). The FSIP group had a greater anatomical success rate than the other groups, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.26). The incidence of postoperative macular hole formation was significantly lower (OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.07-0.54; p = 0.05) in the FSIP group than in the standard ILMP group. The unique characteristics of highly myopic eyes, such as increased axial length and structural changes, may have contributed to the greater incidence of FTMH in the ILMP group.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this meta-analysis, FSIP is the initial surgical approach for early-stage MTM and has shown promising outcomes. However, to establish the safest and most efficient surgical technique for treating different MTM stages, further comparative studies, specifically those focusing on ILMP and FSIP, are necessary.\n",

      " Evaluating the accuracy of the Ophthalmologist Robot for multiple blindness-causing eye diseases: a multicentre, prospective study protocol.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Early eye screening and treatment can reduce the incidence of blindness by detecting and addressing eye diseases at an early stage. The Ophthalmologist Robot is an automated device that can simultaneously capture ocular surface and fundus images without the need for ophthalmologists, making it highly suitable for primary application. However, the accuracy of the device's screening capabilities requires further validation. This study aims to evaluate and compare the screening accuracies of ophthalmologists and deep learning models using images captured by the Ophthalmologist Robot, in order to identify a screening method that is both highly accurate and cost-effective. Our findings may provide valuable insights into the potential applications of remote eye screening.\n",
      "METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, prospective study that will recruit approximately 1578 participants from 3 hospitals. All participants will undergo ocular surface and fundus images taken by the Ophthalmologist Robot. Additionally, 695 participants will have their ocular surface imaged with a slit lamp. Relevant information from outpatient medical records will be collected. The primary objective is to evaluate the accuracy of ophthalmologists' screening for multiple blindness-causing eye diseases using device images through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The targeted diseases include keratitis, corneal scar, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucomatous optic neuropathy and pathological myopia. The secondary objective is to assess the accuracy of deep learning models in disease screening. Furthermore, the study aims to compare the consistency between the Ophthalmologist Robot and the slit lamp in screening for keratitis and corneal scar using the Kappa test. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of three eye screening methods, based on non-telemedicine screening, ophthalmologist-telemedicine screening and artificial intelligence-telemedicine screening, will be assessed by constructing Markov models.\n",
      "ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has obtained approval from the ethics committee of the Ophthalmology and Optometry Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (reference: 2023-026 K-21-01). This work will be disseminated by peer-review publications, abstract presentations at national and international conferences and data sharing with other researchers.\n",

      " Loss-of-function variants in UBAP1L cause autosomal recessive retinal degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of monogenic conditions that can lead to progressive blindness. Their missing heritability is still considerable, due in part to the presence of disease genes that await molecular identification. The purpose of this work was to identify novel genetic associations with IRDs.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation using standard-of-care tests, such as detailed retinal imaging (macular optical coherence tomography and short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence) and electrophysiological testing. Exome and genome sequencing, as well as computer-assisted data analysis were used for genotyping and detection of DNA variants. A minigene-driven splicing assay was performed to validate the deleterious effects of 1 of such variants.\n",
      "RESULTS: We identified 8 unrelated families from Hungary, the United States, Israel, and The Netherlands with members presenting with a form of autosomal recessive and nonsyndromic retinal degeneration, predominantly described as rod-cone dystrophy but also including cases of cone/cone-rod dystrophy. Age of disease onset was very variable, with some patients experiencing first symptoms during their fourth decade of life or later. Myopia greater than 5 diopters was present in 5 of 7 cases with available refractive data, and retinal detachment was reported in 2 cases. All ascertained patients carried biallelic loss-of-function variants in UBAP1L (HGNC: 40028), a gene with unknown function and with homologies to UBAP1, encoding a protein involved in ubiquitin metabolism. One of these pathogenic variants, the intronic NM_001163692.2:c.910-7G>A substitution, was identified in 5 unrelated families. Minigene-driven splicing assays in HEK293T cells confirmed that this DNA change is responsible for the creation of a new acceptor splice site, resulting in aberrant splicing.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We identified UBAP1L as a novel IRD gene. Although its function is currently unknown, UBAP1L is almost exclusively expressed in photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium, hence possibly explaining the link between pathogenic variants in this gene and an ocular phenotype.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To report the long-term anatomical and functional results of macular buckle for Myopic Traction Maculopathy (MTM) in stages 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b according to the MTM Staging System (MSS).\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study involving 55 consecutive patients with MTM in stages 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b who underwent macular buckle (MB). Postoperative outcomes, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans to evaluate the MTM stage and its progression, were evaluated 1-month postoperatively (i.e., \"intermediate follow-up\") and at last follow-up ranging between 6 and 156 months postoperatively (i.e., \"final follow-up\").\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifty-five eyes affected by MTM who underwent MB were enrolled. The mean preoperative and postoperative axial length was 31.13 ± 2.14 and 29.73 ± 2.16 mm, respectively (p < 0.01), with a mean axial shift of 1.32 ± 0.77 mm. The mean sample best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline, intermediate, and final follow-ups was 0.87 ± 0.36, 0.73 ± 0.31, 0.41 ± 0.32 logMar, respectively (p < 0.01). Foveal and retinal anatomical improvements were achieved in 50 (91%) and 53 (96.4%) eyes at intermediate follow-up, respectively. In the final follow-up, 54 (98.2%) and 55 (100%) eyes showed foveal and retinal anatomical improvements, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: MB as a single procedure, when applied to MTM in stages 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b, leads to significant anatomical and functional improvement. The MTM Staging System allows us to evaluate the best surgical technique and the surgical timing tailored to the different stages to increase the surgery's success and lower the complications of each technique.\n"

      " Quercetin Regulates Microglia M1/M2 Polarization and Alleviates Retinal Inflammation via ERK/STAT3 Pathway.\n",
      "Retinal inflammation is a pivotal characteristic observed in various retinal degenerative disorders, notably age-related macular degeneration (AMD), primarily orchestrated by the activation of microglia. Targeting the inhibition of microglial activation has emerged as a therapeutic focal point. Quercetin (Qu), ubiquitously present in dietary sources and tea, has garnered attention for its anti-neuroinflammatory properties. However, the impact of Qu on retinal inflammation and the associated mechanistic pathways remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, retinal inflammation was induced in adult male C57BL/6 J mice through intraperitoneal administration of LPS. The results revealed that Qu pre-treatment induces a phenotypic shift in microglia from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype. Furthermore, Qu attenuated retinal inflammation and stabilized the integrity of the blood-retina barrier (BRB). In vitro experiments revealed that Qu impedes microglial activation, proliferation, and migration, primarily via modulation the ERK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Notably, these actions of Qu significantly contributed to the preservation of photoreceptors. Consequently, Qu pre-treatment holds promise as an effective strategy for controlling retinal inflammation and preserving visual function.\n",

      " Lamellar macular hole in highly myopic eyes and insights into its development, evolution, and treatment: a mini-review.\n",
      "Lamellar macular holes (LMHs) are a manifestation of myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM). Owing to the complex and multidirectional traction force in the elongated eyeball, the clinical features, development, evolution, and treatment algorithms of LMH in highly myopic eyes may differ from those of idiopathic LMH or MTM in general. This review aimed to specifically explore the LMHs in highly myopic eyes. Several developmental processes of LMH and their association with macular retinoschisis have been demonstrated, with the tractional component identified in all processes. Epiretinal proliferation was more prevalent and more extensive in LMHs in highly myopic eyes than in idiopathic LMHs. LMHs in highly myopic eyes may remain stable or progress to foveal detachment and full-thickness macular hole with or without retinal detachment. The predictive factors associated with disease progression were summarized to facilitate monitoring and guide surgical intervention. The treatment of LMHs in highly myopic eyes was based on an algorithm for treating myopic tractional maculopathy, including gas tamponade, pars plana vitrectomy, macular buckling, and a combination of vitrectomy and macular buckling. New internal limiting membrane (ILM) manipulation techniques such as fovea-sparing ILM peeling or fovea-sparing ILM peeling combined with ILM flap insertion could reduce the risk of developing iatrogenic full-thickness macular holes postoperatively. Further research should focus on the treatment of LMH in highly myopic eyes.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the current prevalence and causes of moderate and severe visual impairment (MSVI) and blindness in elderly people in suburban Shanghai, China.\n",
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on the population was conducted, which involved 5846 individuals (11,692 eyes) aged 65 years or older. Thorough eye examinations were performed to assess the prevalence and leading factors of MSVI (BCVA <20/63 to ≥20/400) and blindness (BCVA <20/400).\n",
      "RESULTS: The standardized prevalence of bilateral MSVI and blindness was 3.3% and 0.6%, correspondingly. The standardized prevalence of monocular MSVI and blindness was 7.4% and 2.0%, correspondingly. Cataract (47.9% and 20.7%, correspondingly) and myopic macular degeneration (MMD, 25.7% and 31.1%, correspondingly) were the principal causes of bilateral MSVI and blindness. As for monocular MSVI, the primary causes were cataract (39.4%), age-related macular degeneration (AMD, 16.6%), and MMD (16.6%). The primary causes of monocular blindness were other posterior segment eye diseases (30.1%) and MMD (14.2%). In adults aged 65-74 years, MMD was the foremost factor causing bilateral vision impairment. Conversely, cataract was identified as the primary cause of bilateral and monocular vision impairment among adults aged ≥ 75 years. AMD accounts for a significant proportion of individuals across all age groups.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The most feared complication of intravitreal injections is the development of endophthalmitis, which could lead to irreversible visual loss. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical profiles, causative pathogens, and clinical outcome of patients post-endophthalmitis.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective, single center case series study. Clinical records, causative pathogens and management of all cases of endophthalmitis post intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections recorded between January 1st, 2006 and May 30th, 2022; were retrieved. The visual and anatomic changes prior to the episode of endophthalmitis and up to 2 years post-treatment were compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eleven post-injection endophthalmitis eyes of 10 patients (n = 3 females; 30%) were recruited at mean age of 64.5 ± 20.4 years. The median last recorded BCVA, up to 3 months prior to the episode of endophthalmitis was 60 (Interquartile range (IQR) 55-75) ETDRS letters. Then, it dropped to 30 (IQR 0-57.5), 35 (IQR 0-52.5) and 35 (IQR 0-57.5) ETDRS letters at presentation, 6- and 12-months follow-up; respectively (p = 0.027, p = 0.017 and p = 0.012). However, at 24 months, the median BCVA returned to similar baseline values prior to the episode of endophthalmitis; BCVA 50 (IQR 0-60) ETDRS letters, p = 0.062. Interestingly, two eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD), 1 with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and 1 with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), experienced disease quiescence and did not require additional anti-VEGF injections up to 2 years of follow-up.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates long-term recovery of vision loss due to endophthalmitis post anti-VEGF injections, regained up to 2 years later. It also indicates that disease quiescence post endophthalmitis may not only occur in eyes treated for NVAMD, but also with myopic CNV and RVO.\n"

      " Clinical presentation and macular morphology in retinitis pigmentosa patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, frequently used imaging technology that enables detailed viewing of retina anatomy. It is used to monitor disease progression in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) eyes, including detecting changes in retinal thickness.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to determine the clinical presentation and macular morphology in RP eyes using OCT imaging.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective review of case records and OCT scans in eyes diagnosed with RP in two ophthalmic clinics in Nigeria. Biodata, Snellen best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR), and presence of maculopathy were determined. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifty-five eyes of 28 patients (18 males and 10 females), with a mean age of 47.16 ± 15.56 years (22-77 years), were studied. 40-49 years was the most frequent age group, 28.6%. Severe visual impairment occurred in 22% of eyes and myopia in 32%. Twenty-nine percent had undergone cataract surgery or had a significant cataract. The mean IOP was 11 mmHg, and the mean VCDR was 0.46. On OCT examination, macular atrophy was the most common finding in 74.5% of eyes, epiretinal membrane in 16.3%, cystoid macular edema in 7.3%, vitreomacular adhesion in 5.4%, and vitreomacular traction in 1.8%. There was no association between macular morphology, macular thickness, and BCVA (P = 0.155, P = 0.424).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: OCT provides information on macula structure in RP eyes. About 14.5% of eyes had a normal macula, while 85.5% had a maculopathy, confirming that RP eyes have a higher rate of maculopathy than non RP eyes. OCT evaluation of an RP eye should be a standard workup for the early detection of such maculopathy and monitoring for disease progression.\n"

      " Optical coherence tomography angiography of the macula of high myopia in children and adolescents.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: High myopia represents a health issue and leads to the development of complications that threaten vision. The study of macular changes in high myopia patients has undergone great advances with updated technology via new spectral optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Most of related studies have focused on the adults and additional studies need to investigate macular changes in children and adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the macular structure by OCT and the macular vessel density in high myopia in children and adolescents by OCTA.\n",
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional comparative study. The population was divided into two groups: group 1 (4-11 years) and group 2 (12-18 years). The results were comparable to those of control study of the same age group. The two high myopia groups and the control groups were examined by macular OCT and OCTA to evaluate macular thickness and vessel density in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses.\n",
      "RESULTS: OCT measurements of patients in group 1 revealed that central macular thickness was significantly lower in high myopia group than in the control group and measured 220.91 ± 27.87 μm and 258.23 ± 17.26 μm, respectively, (P < 0.0001). However, in group 2 the central macular thickness in the high myopia group and control group was 236.32 ± 27.76 μm and 247.09 ± 16.81 μm respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). The parafoveal macular thickness and the perifoveal macular quadrants thickness were significantly lower in high myopic children and high myopic adolescents (P < 0.0001) than age matched controls. The parafoveal and perifoveal vessel densities in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses were lower in the high myopia groups than in the age-matched controls in both groups with a few segment exceptions in group 1. The FAZ was significantly wider in group 1 than in the age-matched emmetropes (P = 0.02). The FAZ was wider in group 2 than controls, but the difference was not statistically significant, (P = 0.75).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: High myopic children and adolescents have thinner macular thickness than comparable age-matched emmetropes and have less vessel density in superficial and deep capillary plexuses with a wider FAZ.\n",

      " Evidence for Genetic Causal Relationships Between Multiple Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases and Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Univariable and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Study.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: With the global aging population on the rise, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) poses a growing healthcare burden. Prior research hints at immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) potentially elevating AMD risk via diverse mechanisms. However, causality remains disputed as a result of confounding factors. Hence, our Mendelian randomization (MR) study aims to untangle this link, mitigating confounding effects to explore the IMID-AMD causal relationship. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between IMIDs and AMD, providing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of AMD in clinical practice.\n",
      "METHODS: This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023469815. We obtained data on IMIDs and AMD from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) summary statistics and the FinnGen consortium. Rigorous selection steps were applied to screen for eligible instrumental single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We conducted univariate Mendelian randomization, inverse variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median, Mendelian randomization-Egger (MR-Egger), and multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses. Various sensitivity analysis methods were employed to assess pleiotropy and heterogeneity. The aim was to explore the causal relationships between IMIDs and AMD.\n",
      "RESULTS: The MR analysis revealed that Crohn's disease (CD) (IVW: odd ratios (OR) 1.05, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.01-1.10, p = 0.007), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (IVW: OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15, p = 0.0001), and type 1 diabetes (T1D) (IVW: OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09, p = 0.001) were correlated with an elevated risk of AMD, while multiple sclerosis (MS) (IVW: OR 2.78E-18, 95% CI 2.23E-31 to 3.48E-05, p = 0.008) appeared to be protective against AMD. These findings were supported by an array of MR analysis methodologies and the MVMR approach.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our study results, based on MR, provide genetic evidence indicating a causal relationship between specific IMIDs and AMD. CD, RA, and T1D are factors increasing the risk of AMD, while MS may have a protective effect.\n"

      " Reversal of severe myopia by 24 years of hypotony with subsequent stable refraction after 2 years of normal intraocular pressure.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To report sustained axial length shortening and hyperopic shift (refraction changed from -8 to -2 diopters) induced by 24 years of profound IOP (intraocular pressure) reduction with subsequent refractive stability 2 years after IOP rose to 11-17 mm Hg.\n",
      "OBSERVATIONS: A 25-year-old woman with elevated episcleral venous pressure glaucoma underwent non-penetrating trabeculectomy and subsequent laser goniopuncture in her left eye. She had chronically low IOP (1-12 mm Hg) for the next 24 years. Hypotony maculopathy was present in postoperative years 13-14 and 18-24 but resolved at age 49 when emesis-induced iris prolapse obstructed the filtering passage and transiently raised IOP to 40. Medical management and iridectomy with flap suturing stabilized IOP between 11 and 17 mm Hg.Refraction before OS trabeculectomy was OD -7.50/OS -9.00. In postoperative year 24 spherical equivalent phakic refraction was OD -9.00/OS -1.50. Biometry 1 year after resolution of hypotony showed axial lengths OD 24.8, OS 22.6 mm. Cataract surgery was performed in postoperative years 24/26 (OD/OS) with Tecnis DCBOO intraocular lenses of powers 14.0/21.5 diopters; postoperative refractions, 2 years after OS IOP rose to 11-17 mm Hg, were OD +0.25-0.50 x 015/OS -0.75-1.25 x 160 with 20/25 corrected acuity in each eye.Cardiovascular symptoms 24 years after the onset of her glaucoma led to a diagnosis of severe pulmonary hypertension.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: This case demonstrates that 2 decades of chronic IOP reduction can reverse myopia (by > 2 mm reduction in axial length) with subsequent refractive stability 2 years after IOP normalization. In addition, the case shows that ocular signs of pulmonary hypertension may precede cardiovascular signs by 2 decades.\n"

Additional studies are needed to investigate the progression of myopic maculopathy in this age group, as well as the risk factors associated with progression.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 4-year progression of myopic maculopathy in children and adolescents with high myopia, and to explore potential risk factors.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This hospital-based observational study with 4-year follow-up included a total of 548 high myopic eyes (spherical power -6.00 or less diopters) of 274 participants aged 7 to 17 years. Participants underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination at baseline and 4-year follow-up. Myopic maculopathy was accessed by the International Photographic Classification and Grading System. The data analysis was performed from August 1 to 15, 2023.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The progression of myopic maculopathy progression over 4 years and associated risk factors.\n",
      "RESULTS: The 4-year progression of myopic maculopathy was found in 67 of 548 eyes (12.2%) of 274 participants (138 girls [50.4%] at baseline and 4-year follow-up) with 88 lesion changes, including new signs of the tessellated fundus in 16 eyes (18.2%), diffuse atrophy in 12 eyes (13.6%), patchy atrophy in 2 eyes (2.3%), lacquer cracks in 9 eyes (10.2%), and enlargement of diffuse atrophy in 49 eyes (55.7%). By multivariable analysis, worse best-corrected visual acuity (odds ratio [OR], 6.68; 95% CI, 1.15-38.99; P = .04), longer axial length (AL) (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.34-2.24; P < .001), faster AL elongation (OR, 302.83; 95% CI, 28.61-3205.64; P < .001), and more severe myopic maculopathy (diffuse atrophy; OR, 4.52; 95% CI, 1.98-10.30; P < .001 and patchy atrophy; OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.66-8.80; P = .002) were associated with myopic maculopathy progression.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this observational study, the progression of myopic maculopathy was observed in approximately 12% of pediatric high myopes for 4 years. The major type of progression was the enlargement of diffuse atrophy. Risk factors for myopic maculopathy progression were worse best-corrected visual acuity, longer AL, faster AL elongation, and more severe myopic maculopathy. These findings support consideration of follow-up in these individuals and trying to identify those at higher risk for progression.\n"

      " Characteristics and Prevalence of Staphyloma Edges at Different Ages in Highly Myopic Eyes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of staphyloma edges in highly myopic eyes and how they progress.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data and a longitudinal study with follow-up data from 256 patients (447 eyes) with high myopia, with a mean (SD) follow-up of 3.79 (0.78) years. Participants were divided into four age groups: children (<13), youth (13-24), mature (25-59), and elderly (>60). Ultrawide-field swept-source optical coherence tomography was used to analyze staphyloma edges, which were divided into four areas: nasal to the optic disc (OD), superior to the macula, inferior to the macula, and temporal to the macula.\n",
      "RESULTS: Staphylomas were significantly more prevalent in the mature (42.49%) and the elderly (51.35%) groups than in the children (13%) and youth (9%) groups. Staphyloma edges were predominantly superior to the macula in the mature and elderly groups. In contrast, staphylomas were rare in children and youth, with their edges mainly located nasal to the OD. The edges of staphylomas located superior and temporal to the macula were more likely to be associated with myopic traction maculopathy. During the follow-up period, 11 new staphyloma edges developed primarily in the mature group (64%). Additionally, 12 edges had an increased degree of protrusion over time, with most cases occurring in the mature (75%) group.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and location of staphyloma edges show significant variations depending on age. As time progresses, staphyloma edges manifest at distinct sites and increase their protrusion, potentially playing a role in the emergence of fundus complications.\n"

      " DeepGraFT: A novel semantic segmentation auxiliary ROI-based deep learning framework for effective fundus tessellation classification.\n",
      "Fundus tessellation (FT) is a prevalent clinical feature associated with myopia and has implications in the development of myopic maculopathy, which causes irreversible visual impairment. Accurate classification of FT in color fundus photo can help predict the disease progression and prognosis. However, the lack of precise detection and classification tools has created an unmet medical need, underscoring the importance of exploring the clinical utility of FT. Thus, to address this gap, we introduce an automatic FT grading system (called DeepGraFT) using classification-and-segmentation co-decision models by deep learning. ConvNeXt, utilizing transfer learning from pretrained ImageNet weights, was employed for the classification algorithm, aligning with a region of interest based on the ETDRS grading system to boost performance. A segmentation model was developed to detect FT exits, complementing the classification for improved grading accuracy. The training set of DeepGraFT was from our in-house cohort (MAGIC), and the validation sets consisted of the rest part of in-house cohort and an independent public cohort (UK Biobank). DeepGraFT demonstrated a high performance in the training stage and achieved an impressive accuracy in validation phase (in-house cohort: 86.85 %; public cohort: 81.50 %). Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that DeepGraFT surpasses machine learning-based classification models in FT classification, achieving a 5.57 % increase in accuracy. Ablation analysis revealed that the introduced modules significantly enhanced classification effectiveness and elevated accuracy from 79.85 % to 86.85 %. Further analysis using the results provided by DeepGraFT unveiled a significant negative association between FT and spherical equivalent (SE) in the UK Biobank cohort. In conclusion, DeepGraFT accentuates potential benefits of the deep learning model in automating the grading of FT and allows for potential utility as a clinical-decision support tool for predicting progression of pathological myopia.\n"

      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, participants in the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre-Brien Holden Vision Institute high myopia cohort were followed up every other year for 8 years. Participants with axial length measurements at baseline (2011 or 2012) and at least 1 follow-up visit were included. Participants were grouped according to baseline age as children and adolescents (7 to <18 years), young adults (18 to <40 years), and older adults (≥40 to 70 years). Data were analyzed from November 1, 2022, to June 1, 2023.\n",
      "EXPOSURE: High myopia (spherical power ≤-6.00 diopters).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Longitudinal axial elongation trajectories were identified by cluster analysis. Axial elongation rates were calculated by linear mixed-effects models. A 2-sided P < .05 was defined as statistically significant.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 793 participants (median [range] age, 17.8 [6.8-69.7] years; 418 females [52.7%]) and 1586 eyes were included in the analyses. Mean axial elongation rates were 0.46 mm/y (95% CI, 0.44-0.48 mm/y) for children and adolescents, 0.07 mm/y (95% CI, 0.06-0.09 mm/y) for young adults, and 0.13 mm/y (95% CI, 0.07-0.19 mm/y) for older adults. Cluster analysis identified 3 axial elongation trajectories, with the stable, moderate, and rapid progression trajectories having mean axial elongation rates of 0.02 mm/y (95% CI, 0.01-0.02 mm/y), 0.12 mm/y (95% CI, 0.11-0.13 mm/y), and 0.38 mm/y (95% CI, 0.35-0.42 mm/y), respectively. At 8 years of follow-up, compared with the stable progression trajectory, the rapid progression trajectory was associated with a 6.92 times higher risk of developing pathological myopic macular degeneration (defined as diffuse or patchy chorioretinal atrophy or macular atrophy; odds ratio, 6.92 [95% CI, 1.07-44.60]; P = .04), and it was associated with a 0.032 logMAR decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (β = 0.032 [95% CI, 0.001-0.063]; P = .04).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this 8-year follow-up study suggest that axial length in high myopia continues to increase from childhood to late adulthood following 3 distinct trajectories. At 8 years of follow-up, the rapid progression trajectory was associated with a higher risk of developing pathological myopic macular degeneration and poorer best-corrected visual acuity compared with the stable progression trajectory. These distinct axial elongation trajectories could prove valuable for early identification and intervention for high-risk individuals.\n"

The model's sensitivities to diagnose tessellated fundus (TF), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (DCA), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (PCA), and macular atrophy (MA) were 96.86%, 75.98%, 64.67%, and 88.75%, respectively. The specificity was above 93%, and the AUCs were 0.992, 0.960, 0.964, and 0.989, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The EfficientNet models were used to design grading diagnostic models for myopic maculopathy. Based on the collected fundus images, the models could diagnose a healthy fundus and four types of myopic maculopathy. The models might help ophthalmologists to make preliminary diagnoses of different degrees of myopic maculopathy.\n"

      " Progression of Myopic Maculopathy Based on the ATN Classification System.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Myopic maculopathy is a sight-threatening disease, which causes irreversible vision faults and central vision loss. The purpose of this study is evaluating the risk factors of the myopic maculopathy progression according to the ATN classification system.\n",
      "METHODS: Clinic data of 69 high myopia patients aged older than 40 years with a follow-up time of more than 2 years, who underwent fundus photography and OCT examination were retrospectively collected. Fundus changes were evaluated with ATN classification at the first and last follow-up times. The related factors affecting progress including axial length (AL), spherical equivalence (SE), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), disc-foveal distance (DFD), optic disc tilt, and parapapillary atrophy (PPA) were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: This study included 69 high-myopia patients with mean age 54.29 ± 10.41 years. The progression rate of myopic maculopathy (MM) was approximately 25.56%. Elongated DFD (5.37 ± 0.11 mm vs. 4.86 ± 0.37 mm; p &lt; 0.001) and thinner SFCT (138.52 ± 29.38 μm vs. 184.87 ± 48.72 μm; p = 0.008) at baseline were linked with MM progression. In multiple logistic regression analysis, DFD was a substantial hazard risk factor (adjusted OR = 1.672, 95% CI: 1.135-2.498, p &lt; 0.05) after adjusting for age, AL and SFCT. Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that DFD might serve as a predictor to discriminate the MM progression with a cut-off value of 5.15 mm and a substantial receiver operating characteristic curve area (AUC: 0.794). Compared with the non-progression group, the progression group had older age (p &lt; 0.001), longer AL (p = 0.001), higher optic disc tilt rate (p &lt; 0.001), and higher proportion of pre-existing PPA (p = 0.038) at baseline, the differences were statistically significant.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Based on the ATN classification system, we found that the progression of MM was related to older age, longer AL, high disc tilt, pre-existing PPA, thinner SFCT, and longer DFD. The parameter of DFD was an important factor affecting the progression of MM, which is considered to have a higher probability of progression when the length is beyond 5.15 mm.\n",

      "PURPOSE: High myopia can occur as a single or syndromic condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the refractive error and myopic maculopathy in patients with X-linked retinopathies.\n",
      "METHODS: Whole exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and comprehensive ocular examinations were performed in patients with X-linked retinopathies.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were recruited, including six with CACNA1F, seven with RPGR, three with NYX, and one with OPN1MW mutations. The diagnoses were congenital stationary night blindness (6), cone-rod dystrophy (4), retinitis pigmentosa (4), achromatopsia (1), Leber congenital amaurosis (1), and myopia (1). Myopia was present in 88.2% patients, and 64.7% patients had high myopia. Gene analysis showed that high myopia was present in 80% patients with CACNA1F, 100% patients with NYX, and 57.1% patients with RPGR mutations. In the ATN classification, 64.7% of the patients were A1T0N0 and 35.3% were A0T0N0. The refractive errors progressed over time, even in patients with congenital stationary night blindness. Two females with heterozygous de novo RPGR mutations presented with retinitis pigmentosa or cone rod dystrophy combined with high myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: High myopia is common in patients with X-linked retinopathies, and myopic maculopathy was only mild atrophy without traction and neovascularization.\n"

      "The worldwide incidence and prevalence of myopia has increased. The age of onset of this refractive disorder has inversely decreased. In addition to genetic and familial factors, environmental factors related to a sedentary lifestyle and activities in highly solicited near vision seem to have an impact on the development of axial myopia, that is an early and non-reversible elongation of the eyeball. Prevention of the development of myopia in pediatrics through simple daily measures plays therefore a fundamental role. In addition, pharmacological treatments, and specific optical treatments for controlling myopia have shown encouraging results in reducing the risk of long-term complications of progressive myopia, that is increased risk of developing cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment, or maculopathy.\n",

      " Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived Endothelial Cells Repair Choroidal Ischemia.\n",
      "Choroidal atrophy is a common fundus pathological change closely related to the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa, and pathological myopia. Studies suggest that choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) that form the choriocapillaris vessels are the first cells lost in choroidal atrophy. It is found that endothelial cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-ECs) through the MESP1+ mesodermal progenitor stage express CECs-specific markers and can integrate into choriocapillaris. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies show that hPSC-ECs upregulate angiogenesis and immune-modulatory and neural protective genes after interacting with ex vivo ischemic choroid. In a rat model of choroidal ischemia (CI), transplantation of hPSC-ECs into the suprachoroidal space increases choroid thickness and vasculature density. Close-up examination shows that engrafted hPSC-ECs integrate with all layers of rat choroidal vessels and last 90 days. Remarkably, EC transplantation improves the visual function of CI rats. The work demonstrates that hPSC-ECs can be used to repair choroidal ischemia in the animal model, which may lead to a new therapy to alleviate choroidal atrophy implicated in dry AMD, pathological myopia, and other ocular diseases.\n"

      "METHODS: Retrospective, observational, multicenter case series of eyes with central bouquet hemorrhage. Multimodal imaging features were reviewed and analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Ten eyes from 10 patients (4 women and 6 men), with a mean age of 55.6 ± 21.7 years (range 25-84 years) were included. Underlying etiologies were neovascular age-related macular degeneration (40%), lacquer cracks in pathological myopia (30%), macular telangiectasia Type 2 (10%), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (10%), and ocular trauma associated with angioid streaks (10%). On ophthalmoscopy, all eyes with central bouquet hemorrhage displayed a deep retinal hemorrhage with round margins in the central fovea and associated with petaloid hemorrhages radiating in the surrounding Henle fiber layer. Cross-sectional optical coherence tomography showed a well-delineated round hyperreflective lesion involving the central foveal Henle fiber layer/outer nuclear layer in all cases. Accompanying hyperreflective hemorrhages tracking along the obliquely oriented Henle fiber layer were present in all eyes. Resolution occurred in all patients, either spontaneously (30%) or after treatment with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections (70%), and was associated with partial visual acuity improvement (from 20/113 to 20/36).\n",

      " Characterizing Macular Neovascularization in Myopic Macular Degeneration and Age-Related Macular Degeneration Using Swept Source OCTA.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Visual prognosis and treatment burden for macular neovascularization (MNV) can differ between myopic macular degeneration (MMD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We describe and compare MNV associated with MMD and AMD using swept-source (SS)-OCTA.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with documented MNV associated with MMD or AMD were consecutively recruited. Qualitative and quantitative features were assessed from 6x6mm angiograms, including the MNV area and vessel density (VD). Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were carried out.\n",
      "RESULTS: Out of 75 enrolled eyes with diagnosed MNV (30 MMD-MNV and 45 AMD-MNV; mean age 55±19 and 75±8 years, respectively), 44 eyes had discernible MNV (11 MMD-MNV and 33 AMD-MNV) on SS-OCTA at the time of the study and were included in the analysis. The MMD-MNV group exhibited a three-fold smaller sized MNV (p=0.001), lower greatest linear dimension (p=0.009) and greatest vascular caliber (p<0.001) compared to AMD-MNVs, and had a higher prevalence of tree-in-bud pattern. Eyes with AMD showed a higher prevalence of type 1 MNVs with medusa pattern. There was no difference in the location of the MNV, shape's regularity, margins, presence of core vessel, capillary fringe, peripheral loops, or perilesional dark halo (p>0.05) between both conditions. After adjustment, decreased MNV area and increased VD were associated with the tree-in-bud pattern, whereas the diagnosis did not significantly influence those parameters.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: While larger studies are warranted, this study is the first to describe and compare MMD-MNV and AMD-MNV using SS-OCTA, providing relevant clinical insight on MNV secondary to MMD and AMD. These findings also further validate OCTA as a powerful tool to detect and characterize MNV non-invasively.\n"

      " Insights into myopic choroidal neovascularization based on quantitative proteomics analysis of the aqueous humor.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the biomarkers of pathologic myopia choroidal neovascularization (pmCNV) development merely detected limited types of proteins and provide a meagre illustration of the underlying pathways. Hence, a landscape of protein changes in the aqueous humor (AH) of pmCNV patients is lacking. Here, to explore the potential mechanisms and biomarkers of pmCNV, we analyzed the clinical data and protein profile among atrophic (A) lesions, tractional lesions (T) and neovascular (N) lesions in myopic patients based on the ATN grading system for myopic maculopathy (MM).\n",
      "RESULTS: After investigating demographic data of our patients, a correlation was found between A and N lesions (R = 0.5753, P < 0.0001). Accordingly, groups were divided into patients without MM, patients with myopic atrophic maculopathy (MAM), and patients with pmCNV (N2a lesion). In proteomics analysis, the increased protein level of GFAP and complement-associated molecules in AH samples of the 3 groups also indicated that MAM and pmCNV shared similar characteristics. The GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were performed, which mapped that differential expressed proteins mainly engaged in JAK-STAT pathway between the pmCNV group and two controls. Furthermore, we identified several potential biomarkers for pmCNV, including FCN3, GFAP, EGFR, SFRP3, PPP2R1A, SLIT2, and CD248.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic lesions under pathologic myopic conditions demonstrated similarities to neovascularization development. Potential biomarkers including GFAP were associated with the pathogenesis of pmCNV. In summary, our study provides new insights for further research on pmCNV development.\n"

      " Surgical outcomes of intraocular lens iris suture fixation in eyes with residual capsule support.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and refractive outcomes of eyes after intraocular lens (IOL) iris suture fixation (ISF).\n",
      "SETTING: Private practice, Los Angeles, California.\n",
      "DESIGN: Nonrandomized and unmasked retrospective chart review.\n",
      "METHODS: Eyes that underwent IOL exchange or repositioning with ISF with at least 270 degrees of capsular support were included. Eyes with less than 270 degrees of capsular support and eyes with iris damage were excluded. The primary outcome measures included incidence of cystoid macular edema (CME), IOL dislocation requiring refixation, and chronic inflammation. Secondary outcome measures included worsening intraocular pressure (IOP) control, retinal tear or detachment, worsening of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and corneal decompensation. Refractive outcomes for 26 subgrouped eyes included mean and median spherical equivalent refraction accuracy (SERA), and percentage of eyes within 0.5 diopter (D) and 1 D of the refractive target.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 53 eyes of 50 patients. CME: 2/53 (3.8%), IOL dislocation requiring refixation: 2/53 (3.8%), chronic inflammation: 1/53 (1.9%), worsening IOP control: 5/53 (9.4%), retinal tear or detachment: 2/53 (3.8%). No patient experienced worsening of CDVA from baseline or corneal decompensation. Mean SERA ± SD -0.35 ± 0.29 D, median SERA -0.37 D. Of the 26 eyes subgrouped for refractive analysis, 73% were within 0.5 D and 100% were within 1 D of the desired refractive outcome.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: ISF can offer stability for sulcus-fixated IOLs provided there is some residual capsule support. Although there are measurable complications, there is a relatively low side effect profile. The refractive error tended to be myopic, indicating the need for further refinement of IOL power predictive formulas.\n"

      "METHODS: One thousand three hundred and thirty-four eyes of 991 patients with high myopia were reviewed. A new myopic traction maculopathy staging system classified four retinal stages and three foveal stages. To the myopic traction maculopathy eyes with normal fovea, maculoschisis with and without macular detachment was defined as Stage 3a and Stages 1a, 2a respectively.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and ten (8.25%) eyes with maculoschisis were included, with a follow-up of 24.00 ± 17.47 months. Of them, 84 (76.36%) were Stages 1a, 2a, and 26 (23.64%) were Stage 3a. The visual acuity loss per year during the follow-up period was similar between eyes with Stages 1a, 2a and Stage 3a (3.13 ± 12.21 vs. 3.41 ± 18.42 letters, P = 0.930). Multivariate analyses revealed that vitreomacular interface factors were significantly associated with visual acuity loss during the follow-up, no matter in Stages 1a, 2a or Stage 3a ( P = 0.039 and P = 0.038, respectively). In the Stages 1a, 2a group, the percentage of eyes that lost at least 10 letters at the final visit compared with the baseline visual acuity was higher in eyes with vitreomacular interface factors than in those without vitreomacular interface factors (13 eyes, 50.00% vs. 14 eyes, 24.14%, P = 0.019).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: No differences were found in visual acuity loss pace between Stages 1a, 2a and Stage 3a. Surgical intervention or at least more intensive follow-up should be considered for Stages 1a, 2a eyes with vitreomacular interface factors, to promote a more favorable visual outcome.\n"

      "RESULTS: Through the integration of a multimodal imaging approach, especially optical coherence tomography (OCT), along with accurate demographic and clinical assessment, it becomes possible to effectively differentiate mCNV from similar yet heterogeneous entities. These conditions include macular hemorrhage due to new lacquer crack (LC) formation, inflammatory diseases such as punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC)/multifocal choroidits (MFC) and epiphenomenon multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (Epi-MEWDS), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), idiopathic CNV (ICNV), dome-shaped macula (DSM) with subretinal fluid, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) humps, angioid streaks (AS), choroidal rupture (CR), and choroidal osteoma (CO). Each one of these entities will be described and discussed in this article.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Myopic choroidal neovascularization is a common retinal condition, especially among young individuals. Accurate diagnosis and differentiation from similar conditions are crucial for effective treatment. Multimodal imaging, particularly OCT, plays a crucial role in precise assessment.

      " Staphyloma-induced Serous Maculopathy: Natural Course and Treatment Effects.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To study the natural course of staphyloma-induced serous maculopathy (SISM) and the effects of treatments.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective analysis included 26 eyes of 20 patients with SISM and at least 12 months of follow-up.\n",
      "METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, such as age, sex, spherical equivalent, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), type of staphyloma, and imaging characteristics. Spectralis OCT B-scans were evaluated for the presence and height of the serous retinal detachment (SRD) at each follow-up visit. An SRD episode was defined as a period with SRD in 1 patient.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in SRD height and BCVA.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-six eyes of 20 patients (70% female) were included. The mean age was 54 ± 11 years, and the mean spherical equivalent was -4.8 ± 3.3 diopters at baseline. The staphyloma was located inferior in 12 eyes (46%), inferonasal in 7 eyes (27%), and nasal in 7 eyes (27%). The mean follow-up duration was 73 ± 34 months. During follow-up, the SRD height fluctuated in all eyes, with a mean change of 125 ± 56 μm. The SRD disappeared completely during follow-up in 13 eyes (50%) and then reappeared in 7 eyes (35%). Resolution occurred spontaneous in 8 eyes (31%). The median time of an SRD episode was 25 (interquartile range 14-57) months. Treatment was performed in 20 eyes (77%) and led to resolution of SRD in 3 of the 15 photodynamic therapy treatments (21%), 2 of 5 (40%) anti-VEGF series, and 2 of 4 eyes (50%) treated with topical prednisolone. Best-corrected visual acuity at the final visit (0.42 ± 0.25) was not significantly different from BCVA at baseline (0.34 ± 0.27 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, P = 0.07), nor was BCVA change significantly different between treated eyes (n = 19) and nontreated eyes (n = 7, P = 0.3).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Serous retinal detachment in patients with SISM fluctuated over time and resolved without treatment in 31% of the eyes. Because treatment does not change the course of BCVA, a wait-and-see policy is advocated in these patients on the exclusion of treatable causes of SRD.\n",

      " Choroidal Perfusion Changes After Vitrectomy for Myopic Traction Maculopathy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The choroidal vasculature supplies the outer retina and is altered in many retinal diseases, including myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Choroid health is typically assessed by measuring the choroidal thickness; however, this method has substantial limitations. The choroidal vascularity index (CVI) was recently introduced to provide quantitative information on the vascular flow in the choroid. This index has been evaluated in a wide range of diseases but has not been extensively used to characterize MTM.\n",
      "AIM: This study aimed to investigate the CVI across different stages of MTM and the influence of macular surgery on choroidal perfusion markers in different surgically resolved MTM stages.\n",
      "METHODS: Eighteen healthy myopic eyes in the control group and forty-six MTM eyes in the surgical group were evaluated using enhanced optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Binarized OCT images were processed to obtain the luminal choroidal area (LCA) and stromal choroidal area (SCA), which were used to calculate CVI in the form of a percentage ratio. CVI data were collected at baseline, one and four months postoperatively, and at the final clinical visit. MTM eyes were divided into four stages based on disease severity. The choriocapillaris flow area (CFA) and central subfield thickness (CSFT) were measured along side the CVI.\n",
      "RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the two groups at baseline, except for visual acuity (\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find significant preoperative differences in CVI between healthy myopic eyes and eyes with MTM. However, the postoperative CVI and CFA values were significantly lower than those of the control eyes. Thus, CVI may not be a good biomarker for surgical outcomes, as the correlation between CVI and visual acuity was not statistically significant.The CVI and CFA decreased after surgery, providing evidence of choroidal changes after surgical management.\n"

      " LONGITUDINAL CHANGES OF POSTERIOR VORTEX VEINS IN HIGHLY MYOPIC EYES DETERMINED BY RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES OF INDOCYANINE GREEN ANGIOGRAMS.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the longitudinal changes of the posterior vortex veins (VVs) in highly myopic (HM) eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: The medical records of 1,730 consecutive HM eyes that had undergone indocyanine green angiography were studied. Eyes that had posterior VVs and had undergone at least two indocyanine green angiography examinations with a minimum interval of 3 years were selected from this group.\n",
      "RESULTS: Ninety-one eyes of 78 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 124 posterior VVs were identified. Over an average interval of 7.8 ± 5.0 years, 41 (33.1%) of the 124 posterior VVs had marked changes consisting mainly of an attenuation of vessels in 36 posterior VVs (87.8%) and alterations in the drainage course in 16 posterior VVs (39.0%). Fifteen posterior VVs had both types of changes. Most of the attenuations of the vessels occurred for smaller branches, but a complete loss of the entire trunk was seen in three eyes. Additionally, four eyes had posterior VV changes in association with changes of peripheral VVs.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Posterior VV in highly myopic eyes can undergo changes with increasing time. The associated factors included the development and progression of myopic maculopathy lesions. In some cases, the blood drainage shifted from posterior VV to peripheral VV by forming anastomotic channels.\n",

      "METHODS: There were 100 eyes from 77 patients in this study. We used 1:1 matching axial length in myopic eyes. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of MTM. Fundus structure parameters were obtained by swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT), and the optic disc microcirculation parameters were obtained by OCT angiography (OCTA).\n",
      "RESULTS: MTM group were older (P = 0.001) and had poorer Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) (P = 0.011), the optic disc-fovea distance (DFD) was longer (P < 0.019), optic disc tilt was greater (P < 0.001), area of peripapillary atrophy (PPA) was larger (P < 0.001), and PPA/optical disc area (ONH) was higher (P < 0.001). The peripapillary scleral thickness (PST) was lower in the MTM group (P < 0.001). The mean peripapillary choroidal thickness (PCT) (P < 0.001) and PCT in the 10 orientations were significantly lower in the MTM group than in the NMTM group (all P < 0.01). Vascular density in the nasosuperior (NS) region of the optic disc was significantly lower in the MTM group (P = 0.037). The generalized estimating equation suggested that PPA area (P = 0.028), mean PCT (P = 0.008), superior PCT (P = 0.027), inferonasal PCT (P = 0.040), temporoinferior PCT (P = 0.013), and PST (P = 0.046) correlated with MTM. Age, axial length, optic disc tilt, PPA area, mean PCT, and optic disc central zone (0-2 mm) vascular density (all P < 0.05) were significantly correlated with PST.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The enlarged PPA area and thinner PCT and PST in eyes with MTM are more significant. Lower PST in high myopia was related to abnormalities of PCT and microcirculation.\n",

      " Intraocular cetuximab: Safety and effect on axial elongation in young Guinea pigs with lens-induced myopization.\n",
      "This study aimed to examine the intraocular tolerability of the epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab, when applied intravitreally, and its effect on axial elongation. Guinea pigs aged 2-3 weeks were subjected to bilateral plano glasses and bilateral lens-induced myopization (LIM) as a single procedure for group I (n = 8) and group II (n = 8), respectively. In the animals of group III (n = 8), group IV (n = 8), and group V (n = 8), the right eyes of the animals, in addition to LIM, received four weekly intravitreal injections of cetuximab (Erbitux®) in doses of 6.25 μg, 12.5 μg, and 25 μg, respectively. As controls, the left eyes, in addition to LIM, received corresponding intraocular injections of phosphate-buffered saline. The animals underwent regular ophthalmoscopic examinations and biometry for axial length measurements. With increasing doses of cetuximab, the inter-eye difference in axial elongation (at study end, left eyes minus right eyes) were significantly the smallest in group I (0.00 ± 0.02 mm) and group II (-0.01 ± 0.02 mm), they were larger in group III (0.04 ± 0.04 mm) and group IV (0.10 ± 0.03 mm), and they were the largest in group V (0.11 ± 0.01 mm). The inter-eye difference in axial elongation enlarged (P < 0.001) with the number of injections applied. Retinal thickness at the posterior pole (right eyes) was significantly thicker in group V than in group II (P < 0.01). The density of apoptotic cells (visualized by TUNEL-staining) did not vary significantly between any of the groups (all P > 0.05). The results suggest that intravitreal injections of cetuximab in young guinea pigs with LIM resulted in a reduction in axial elongation in a dose-dependent and number of treatment-dependent manner. Intraocular toxic effects, such as intraocular inflammation, retinal thinning, or an increased density of apoptotic cells in the retina, were not observed in association with the intravitreally applied cetuximab.\n",

      " Visual impairment and blindness caused by retinal diseases: A nationwide register-based study.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Retinal disorders cause substantial visual burden globally. Accurate estimates of the vision loss due to retinal diseases are pivotal to inform optimal eye health care planning and allocation of medical resources. The purpose of this study is to describe the proportion of visual impairment and blindness caused by major retinal diseases in China.\n",
      "METHODS: A nationwide register-based study of vitreoretinal disease covering all 31 provinces (51 treating centres) of mainland China. A total of 28 320 adults diagnosed with retinal diseases were included. Participants underwent standardised ocular examinations, which included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), dilated-fundus assessments, and optical coherence tomography. Visual impairment and blindness are defined using BCVA according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (visual impairment: <20/63-≥20/400; blindness: <20/400) and the United States (visual impairment: <20/40-≥20/200; blindness: <20/200) definitions. The risk factors of vision loss were explored by logistic regression analyses.\n",
      "RESULTS: Based on the WHO definitions, the proportions for unilateral visual impairment and blindness were 46% and 18%, respectively, whereas those for bilateral visual impairment and blindness were 31% and 3.3%, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) accounts for the largest proportion of patients with visual impairment (unilateral visual impairment: 32%, bilateral visual impairment: 60%) and blindness (unilateral blindness: 35%; bilateral blindness: 64%). Other retinal diseases that contributed significantly to vision loss included age-related macular degeneration, myopic maculopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and other macular diseases. Women (bilateral vision loss: P = 0.011), aged patients (unilateral vision loss: 45-64 years: P < 0.001, ≥65 years: P < 0.001; bilateral vision loss: 45-64 years: P = 0.003, ≥65 years: P < 0.001 (reference: 18-44 years)) and those from Midwest China (unilateral and bilateral vision loss: both P < 0.001) were more likely to suffer from vision loss.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Retinal disorders cause substantial visual burden among patients with retinal diseases in China. DR, the predominant retinal disease, is accountable for the most prevalent visual disabilities. Better control of diabetes and scaled-up screenings are warranted to prevent DR. Specific attention should be paid to women, aged patients, and less developed regions.\n"

      " Machine Learning Models for Predicting Long-Term Visual Acuity in Highly Myopic Eyes.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: High myopia is a global concern due to its escalating prevalence and the potential risk of severe visual impairment caused by pathologic myopia. Using artificial intelligence to estimate future visual acuity (VA) could help clinicians to identify and monitor patients with a high risk of vision reduction in advance.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To develop machine learning models to predict VA at 3 and 5 years in patients with high myopia.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, single-center, cohort study was performed on patients whose best-corrected VA (BCVA) at 3 and 5 years was known. The ophthalmic examinations of these patients were performed between October 2011 and May 2021. Thirty-four variables, including general information, basic ophthalmic information, and categories of myopic maculopathy based on fundus and optical coherence tomography images, were collected from the medical records for analysis.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Regression models were developed to predict BCVA at 3 and 5 years, and a binary classification model was developed to predict the risk of developing visual impairment at 5 years. The performance of models was evaluated by discrimination metrics, calibration belts, and decision curve analysis. The importance of relative variables was assessed by explainable artificial intelligence techniques.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 1616 eyes from 967 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [14.0] years; 678 female [70.1%]) were included in this analysis. Findings showed that support vector machines presented the best prediction of BCVA at 3 years (R2 = 0.682; 95% CI, 0.625-0.733) and random forest at 5 years (R2 = 0.660; 95% CI, 0.604-0.710). To predict the risk of visual impairment at 5 years, logistic regression presented the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.870; 95% CI, 0.816-0.912). The baseline BCVA (logMAR odds ratio [OR], 0.298; 95% CI, 0.235-0.378; P < .001), prior myopic macular neovascularization (OR, 3.290; 95% CI, 2.209-4.899; P < .001), age (OR, 1.578; 95% CI, 1.227-2.028; P < .001), and category 4 myopic maculopathy (OR, 4.899; 95% CI, 1.431-16.769; P = .01) were the 4 most important predicting variables and associated with increased risk of visual impairment at 5 years.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Study results suggest that developing models for accurate prediction of the long-term VA for highly myopic eyes based on clinical and imaging information is feasible. Such models could be used for the clinical assessments of future visual acuity.\n",

      " Management of Myopic Maculopathy: A Review.\n",
      "Myopia, including pathologic myopia, has seen a significant increase in prevalence in recent years. It is a significant cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide and prediction models demonstrate the substantial future impact on the population. With increased awareness and research, it is possible to prevent blindness on a large scale in the younger, productive age group affected by myopic maculopathy (MM). The vision-threatening manifestations of pathologic myopia include myopic choroidal neovascularization, macular atrophy, maculoschisis, macular hole, and retinal detachment. Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) is a progressive manifestation of pathologic myopia and its treatment includes pars plana vitrectomy, macular buckle, or a combination. In this article we aim to review the diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of MM with an emphasis on recent developments in the surgical management of MTM. We discuss commercially available macular buckles, along with potential advantages to the use of macular buckle in MM. We review the new MTM staging system and its role in determining surgical management of these complex cases.\n"

      " Optic Nerve Head Abnormalities in Nonpathologic High Myopia and the Relationship With Visual Field.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To describe the optic nerve head (ONH) abnormalities in nonpathologic highly myopic eyes based on swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the relationship with visual field (VF).\n",
      "DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a longitudinal cohort study.\n",
      "METHODS: Highly myopic patients without myopic maculopathy of category 2 or higher were enrolled. All participants underwent a swept-source OCT examination focused on ONH. We differentiated between 3 major types (optic disc morphologic abnormality, papillary/peripapillary tissue defect, and papillary/peripapillary schisis) and 12 subtypes of ONH abnormalities. The prevalence and characteristics of ONH abnormalities and the relationship with VF were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 857 participants (1389 eyes) were included. Among the 1389 eyes, 91.86%, 68.61%, and 34.92% of them had at least 1, 2, or 3 ONH abnormalities, respectively, which corresponded to 29.55%, 31.79%, and 35.67% of VF defects, respectively. Among the 12 subtypes of the 3 major types, peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structure, visible retrobulbar subarachnoid space, and prelaminar schisis were the most common, respectively. Perimetric defects corresponding to OCT abnormalities were more commonly found in eyes with peripapillary retinal detachment, peripapillary retinoschisis, and peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structure. Glaucoma-like VF defects were more common in eyes with deep optic cups (28.17%) and with optic disc pit/pit-like change (18.92%).\n",

      " Clinical Evaluation of MyoCare in Europe (CEME): study protocol for a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, and controlled clinical trial.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopia prevalence has been increasing in the last decades, and its pathological consequences, including myopic maculopathy and high myopia-associated optic neuropathy, are now one of the most common causes of visual impairment. It is estimated that by 2050, more than 50% of Europeans and Americans will be myopes, which is alarming due to the high morbidity of myopes over - 6.00D. Once myopia has appeared, there are different options with scientific evidence to try to slow the axial length growth. Ophthalmic lenses are the less invasive treatment to control myopia, and there is evidence about the efficacy of different designs, mainly in the Asiatic population. However, new designs have been launched, and it is not known if efficacy is the same between Asiatic and European subjects. Thus, we have set up a randomized, controlled, double-blind, and multicenter trial to investigate the efficacy of a new design of ophthalmic lenses for myopia control in European children.\n",
      "METHODS: A 2-year prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, and double-blind clinical trial is used to investigate the efficacy of a new design of ophthalmic lenses to slow the progression of myopia. Three hundred children aged from 6 to 13 years old will be recruited and randomly assigned to a study or control group. The study group will be composed of 150 children wearing MyoCare while the control group will be composed of 150 children wearing Clearview. The inclusion criteria will be myopia with a spherical equivalent between - 0.75D and - 5.00D, astigmatism < 1.50D, and anisometropia < 1.00D and having a historical evolution of at least - 0.50 The primary outcome is to compare the mean annual progression of the spherical equivalent between both groups. The secondary outcomes are axial length, choroidal thickness, phorias, and accommodative status of both groups.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: This study will be the first randomized and controlled clinical trial in European children with spectacle lenses based on simultaneous competing defocus. The results will shed light on the clinical evidence of spectacle lenses relying on this new design for the management of myopia with results of efficacy in the non-Asiatic population.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often considered the gold standard and the cornerstone for clinical practice. However, bibliometric studies on worldwide RCTs of ophthalmology published in the 21st century have not been reported in detail yet. This study aims to perform a bibliometric study and visualization analysis of worldwide ophthalmologic RCTs in the 21st century.\n",
      "METHODS: Global ophthalmologic RCTs from 2000 to 2022 were searched in the Web of Science Core Collection. The number of publications, country/region, institution, author, journal, and research hotspots of RCTs were analyzed using HistCite, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Excel software.\n",
      "RESULTS: 2366 institutions and 90 journals from 83 countries/regions participated in the publication of 1769 global ophthalmologic RCTs, with the United States leading in the number of volumes and research field, and the Moorfields Eye Hospital contributing to the most publications. Ophthalmology received the greatest number of publications and co-citations. Jeffrey S. Heier owned the most publications and Jost B. Jonas owned the most co-citations. The knowledge foundations of global ophthalmologic RCTs were mainly retinopathy, glaucoma, dry eye disease (DED), and cataracts, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (ranibizumab), topical ocular hypotensive medication, laser trabeculoplasty. Anti-VEGF therapy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), DME (diabetic macular edema), and DED, the use of new diagnostic tools, and myopia were the hottest research highlights. Anti-VEGF therapy, prompt laser, triamcinolone, and verteporfin photodynamic therapy for AMD, DME, and CNV (choroidal neovascularization), DED, myopia, and open-angle glaucoma were the research hotspots with the longest duration. The future research hotspots might be DED and the prevention and control of myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the number of global ophthalmologic RCTs in the 21st century was keeping growing, there was an imbalance between the regions and institutions, and more efforts are required to raise the quantity, quality, and global impact of high-quality clinical evidence in developing countries/regions.\n"

      " Comparative analysis of the quality of life among different retinal diseases.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the impact on the quality of life (QoL) among different retinal diseases such as diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), pathologic myopia (PM), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).\n",
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 241 patients, affected by DME (n=44), RVO (n=41), PM (n=34) and nAMD (n=85) receiving intravitreal injections due to the presence of macular edema or choroidal neovascularization. The CSC patients included (n=37) were candidates for laser treatment. The patients included completed the National Eye Visual Functioning Questioning-25 (NEI VFQ-25). Best eye visual acuity (BEVA) was recorded using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale.\n",
      "RESULTS: There were significant differences between subgroups for all the domains, except for the general vision in which all scores among diseases ranged from 40.7 to 45.2 out of 100 (P=.436), despite the difference in BEVA (CSC: 86.3±11.9; RVO: 78.5±15.5, DME: 73.3±15.2, nAMD: 72.9±12.6 and PM: 68.5±18.1 letters respectively; P<.001). The lowest VFQ-25 total score was observed in the PM patients (52.1±20.9), followed by nAMD (55.3±20.8), RVO (65.0±22.3), DME (68.6±21.0) and CSC (70.9±16.2). The DME group reported the worst score for general health (38.9±21.4). Mental health and role difficulties were lowest for PM (48.2±28.8 and 48.2±31.9, P<.007).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the differences in the QoL among DME, RVO, nAMD, PM and CSC, describing the different repercussions that they can suffer, observing a higher impact in PM and nAMD.\n",

      " Clinical Features of Fundus Tessellation and Its Relationship with Myopia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: This study aims to assess the existing literature on fundus tessellation (FT), focusing on its prevalence, associated factors, distribution, and progression.\n",
      "METHODS: Systemic methods were employed to search and gather published literature on FT from databases such as the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Web of Science (WOS), and Elsevier on July 1, 2023. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare tessellated and normal fundus with respect to age, gender, axial length, and spherical equivalent.\n",
      "RESULTS: The systematic review included 23 articles, encompassing a total of 3053 eyes in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of FT varied from 43.00 to 94.35%. The severity of FT was significantly associated with older age, male sex, lower body weight index, longer axial length, larger peripapillary atrophy, thinner choroid, thinner sclera, and larger corneal radius of curvature, suggesting a potential progression pattern. Notably, FT was observed predominantly in the macular and peripapillary regions. The meta-analysis revealed that tessellated fundus tended to be associated with older age (mean difference [MD] 4.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-7.80, P < 0.01), longer axial length (MD 0.86, 95% CI 0.70-1.02, P < 0.01), and a lower spherical equivalent (MD - 1.16, 95% CI - 1.68 to 0.65, P < 0.01) compared to normal fundus. However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of males between individuals with tessellated and normal fundus (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.89-1.42, P = 0.32).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this systematic review and meta-analysis shed light on the prevalence, characteristics, and factors associated with FT, offering valuable insights for clinicians and researchers in the field of ophthalmology.\n",
      "STUDY REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42023442486).\n"

      "PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for fundus pathology in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a cohort from northeastern China.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients were included from the Fushun Diabetic Retinopathy Cohort Study. Patients aged ≥ 30 years with T2DM were recruited between July 2012 and May 2013. Fundus pathology included retinal vascular occlusion (RVO), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular pathology, pathologic myopia (PM) and glaucomatous optic atrophy (GOA).\n",
      "RESULTS: A Total of 1998 patients with gradable fundus photographs were included in this study, of whom 388 (19.42%) had fundus pathology regardless of whether they had diabetic retinopathy (DR). There were 187 (9.36%) patients with AMD, 97 (4.85%) with GOA, 67 (3.35%) with macular pathology, 35 (1.75%) with PM and 23 (1.15%) with RVO. Advanced age was significantly associated with AMD (odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.01-1.05), macular pathology (OR, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.03-1.09) and GOA (OR, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.04-1.09). A wider central retinal arteriolar equivalent was protective against PM (OR, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.66-0.92). Wider central retinal venular equivalent was a protective factor for PM (OR, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.68-0.82) and GOA (OR, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.87-0.99).\n",

      " Low concentration atropine and myopia: a narrative review of the evidence for United Kingdom based practitioners.\n",
      "The prevalence of myopia is increasing across the world. Controlling myopia progression would be beneficial to reduce adverse outcomes such as retinal detachment and myopic maculopathy which are associated with increased axial length. Pharmacological control of myopia progression with atropine has been investigated since the 19th century and the benefits of slowing myopia progression are considered against the side-effects of near blur and photophobia. More recently, randomised trials have focused on determining the optimum concentration of atropine leading to low-concentration atropine being used to manage myopia progression by practitioners across the world. Currently, in the United Kingdom, there is no licensed pharmacological intervention for myopia management. The aim of this review is to interpret the available data to inform clinical practice. We conducted a narrative review of the literature and identified peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials using the search terms 'myopia' and 'atropine', limited to the English language. We identified two key studies, which were the Atropine in the Treatment Of Myopia (ATOM) and Low-concentration Atropine for Myopia Progression (LAMP). Further studies were identified using the above search terms and the references from the identified literature. Atropine 0.01% has a modest effect on controlling axial length progression. Atropine 0.05% appears to be superior to atropine 0.01% in managing myopia progression. There is a dose-dependent rebound effect when treatment is stopped. Atropine is a well-tolerated, safe, and effective intervention. Treatment would be needed for several years and into adolescence, until axial length progression is stable.\n",

      "The risk of eye diseases such as myopic macular degeneration increases with the level of myopia, but there is no safe level of myopia and the burden of lower degrees of myopia remains considerable. Effective treatments are available that slow progression and thus limit the final degree of myopia. In this review, the rationale for slowing progression is summarized, and a case made for treating all myopic children. Measurement of refractive error and axial length is reviewed, stressing the precision of optical biometry, but also the need for cycloplegic autorefraction. The factors influencing progression are considered and the available tools for interpretation of progression rate are discussed. Finally, the need to set attainable treatment goals is emphasized.\n"

      " Endoplasmic reticulum stress: molecular mechanism and therapeutic targets.\n",
      "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions as a quality-control organelle for protein homeostasis, or \"proteostasis\". The protein quality control systems involve ER-associated degradation, protein chaperons, and autophagy. ER stress is activated when proteostasis is broken with an accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the ER. ER stress activates an adaptive unfolded protein response to restore proteostasis by initiating protein kinase R-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol requiring enzyme 1. ER stress is multifaceted, and acts on aspects at the epigenetic level, including transcription and protein processing. Accumulated data indicates its key role in protein homeostasis and other diverse functions involved in various ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, achromatopsia, cataracts, ocular tumors, ocular surface diseases, and myopia. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying the aforementioned ocular diseases from an ER stress perspective. Drugs (chemicals, neurotrophic factors, and nanoparticles), gene therapy, and stem cell therapy are used to treat ocular diseases by alleviating ER stress. We delineate the advancement of therapy targeting ER stress to provide new treatment strategies for ocular diseases.\n",

      " Tear inflammatory cytokines as potential biomarkers for myopic macular degeneration.\n",
      "Previous studies have reported that inflammatory cytokine levels increase in the intraocular fluids (aqueous humor and vitreous) of highly myopic eyes, However, there has been currently no study revealing the levels of inflammatory cytokines in tear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine tear cytokine levels of highly myopic eyes, and their relationships with myopic macular degeneration (MMD). This case-control study screened inflammatory cytokines of tear samples from 132 highly myopic and 105 emmetropic eyes using a multiplex cytokine antibody array, and cytokines showing significant intergroup differences were further validated using ProQuantum immunoassays in tear samples from another 60 highly myopic and 60 emmetropic eyes. Ultra-widefield fundus photographs of eyes were classified according to the meta-analyses of the Pathologic Myopia Classification. Associations between tear cytokine levels and MMD category were investigated. As a result, tear levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-13 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were screened significantly higher in highly myopic eyes than in emmetropic controls (IL-6: 11.70 ± 16.81 versus 8.22 ± 10.76 pg/mL; MCP-1: 63.60 ± 54.40 versus 33.87 ± 43.82 pg/mL; both P < 0.05). Validation assays further demonstrated the elevated concentrations of IL-6 and MCP-1 (IL-6: 13.97 ± 8.41 versus 8.06 ± 7.94 pg/mL, P < 0.001; MCP-1: 32.69 ± 8.41 versus 18.07 ± 8.41 pg/mL, P = 0.003). Tear levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 differed significantly among MMD categories (both P < 0.05). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.783 and 0.682 respectively (both P < 0.05), when using tear IL-6 and MCP-1 levels to predict the presence of MMD (category ≥2). The ordered logistic regression model also indicated that longer axial length, and higher IL-6 and MCP-1 tear levels were independent predictors of higher MMD category. In our study, highly myopic eyes presented significantly higher levels of tear IL-6 and MCP-1, which may also serve as potential biomarkers for MMD.\n"

This article presents a summary of the key points covered during the 2022 Ophthalmologica Lecture held at the Euretina Congress in Hamburg. The first part of the article focuses on the use of optical coherence tomography angiography to examine and comprehend the choroid in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Subsequently, we delve into the discussion of the \"postreceptor neuronal loss\" theory in AMD, which was studied using en face structural optical coherence tomography (OCT). Following that, we explore pertinent findings obtained through cross-sectional OCT in retinal and optic nerve diseases, such as AMD, diabetic macular edema, pathologic myopia, central serous chorioretinopathy, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.\n",

      "METHODS: This retrospective study included 82 eyes with treatment-naïve mCNV who were treated with pro re nata injections of ranibizumab or aflibercept.\n",
      "RESULTS: Nine eyes (11.0%) presented with macular PA at baseline (PA group), and 73 eyes (89.0%) did not (non-PA group). VA improved during the first year in the non-PA group; a similar trend was noted in the PA group until 3 months after initial treatment. This improvement was maintained until 24 months ( P < 0.001) in the non-PA group, but not in the PA group. In the PA group, macular chorioretinal atrophy progressed faster ( P < 0.0001), and CNV-MA was more frequent during the 2 years of treatments ( P = 0.04). Even non-PA group eyes sometimes developed CNV-MA (42% at Month 24) if they had a larger CNV and thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness at baseline, resulting in poorer visual prognosis ( P < 0.01).\n",

      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of vision impairment causes.\n",
      "RESULTS: 212 highly myopic eyes from 154 participants were included with a mean age of 56.2 ± 9.6 years, a mean refractive error of -9.87 ± 3.70 D and a mean axial length of 27.2 ± 1.3 mm. We observed moderate/severe vision impairment (MSVI) in 40 eyes (18.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.6-24.2) and blindness in 10 eyes (4.7%; 95% CI, 1.8-7.6). Primary causes for MSVI and blindness were myopic macular degeneration (MMD) (29/50; 58%), age-related macular degeneration (1/50; 2%), and branch macular retinal vein occlusion (1/50; 2%). Secondary causes were MMD (4/50; 8%) and optic nerve atrophy (14/50, 28%), further differentiated into non-glaucomatous optic atrophy (NGOA) (9/50; 18%) and glaucomatous optic atrophy (GOA) (5/50; 10%). Prevalence of MMD as vision impairment cause increased significantly from 1/61 (1.6%) in the refractive error group of -6.00 to ≥-7.00 D, to 16/25 (64%) in the group of <-15.0 D. Higher MMD prevalence correlated with higher myopic refractive error (P < 0.001) and increased likelihood of concomitant optic neuropathy (P < 0.001). Similarly, prevalence of optic neuropathy as vision impairment cause increased from 0/61 (0%) in the refractive error group of -6.00 D to ≥-7.00 D, to 9/25 (36%) in the group of <-15.0 D.

      " Clinical, biochemical and molecular analysis in a cohort of individuals with gyrate atrophy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by biallelic variants in the OAT gene, encoding the enzyme ornithine δ-aminotransferase. Impaired enzymatic activity leads to systemic hyperornithinaemia, which in turn underlies progressive chorioretinal degeneration. In this study, we describe the clinical and molecular findings in a cohort of individuals with gyrate atrophy.\n",
      "METHODS: Study participants were recruited through a tertiary UK clinical ophthalmic genetic service. All cases had a biochemical and molecular diagnosis of gyrate atrophy. Retrospective phenotypic and biochemical data were collected using electronic healthcare records.\n",
      "RESULTS: 18 affected individuals from 12 families (8 male, 10 female) met the study inclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 8 years (range 10 months - 33 years) and all cases had hyperornithinaemia (median: 800 micromoles/L; range: 458-1244 micromoles/L). Common features at presentation included high myopia (10/18) and nyctalopia (5/18). Ophthalmic findings were present in all study participants who were above the age of 6 years. One third of patients had co-existing macular oedema and two thirds developed pre-senile cataracts. Compliance with dietary modifications was suboptimal in most cases. A subset of participants had extraocular features including a trend towards reduced fat-free mass and developmental delay.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of multidisciplinary care in families with gyrate atrophy. Secondary ophthalmic complications such as macular oedema and cataract formation are common. Management of affected individuals remains challenging due to the highly restrictive nature of the recommended diet and the limited evidence-base for current strategies.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To perform an unsupervised machine learning clustering of patients with punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) and provide new insights into the significance of pachychoroid disease features in PIC eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study, including 102 eyes from 82 patients diagnosed with PIC. Demographics, clinical data, and multimodal imaging, including fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and indocyanine green angiography, were collected. Clusters of eyes were identified, and multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to compare between-group differences.\n",
      "RESULTS: Using 17 clinical features, two distinct clusters of patients with PIC were identified. Cluster 1 patients were characterized by older age, high myopia, myopic maculopathy features, thin choroids, multiple lesions, and a higher likelihood of developing patchy chorioretinal atrophy. Cluster 2 consisted of younger age, emmetropia or low myopia, thick choroids, choroidal vascular hyperpermeability on late-phase indocyanine green angiography, and high prevalence of focal choroidal excavation. These features exhibited significant differences ( P < 0.05) between the two clusters.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: While PIC typically affects young myopic female patients with thin choroids, a subset of patients with PIC exhibits features associated with pachychoroid disease. Considering the potential influence of choroidal venous insufficiency on PIC manifestations and secondary complications, we propose the term \"punctate inner pachychoroidopathy\" to characterize this distinct subtype of PIC.\n",

Addressing this issue requires strategies to reduce myopia prevalence and prevent progression to high myopia. Encouraging outdoor activities for schoolchildren and reducing near-work and screen time can effectively prevent myopia development, offering a safe intervention that promotes healthier habits. Several clinical approaches can be employed to decelerate myopia progression, such as administering low-dose atropine eye drops (0.05%), utilizing orthokeratology lenses, implementing soft contact lenses equipped with myopia control features, and incorporating spectacle lenses with aspherical lenslets. When choosing an appropriate strategy, factors such as age, ethnicity, and the rate of myopia progression should be considered. However, some treatments may encounter obstacles such as adverse side effects, high costs, complex procedures, or limited effectiveness. Presently, low-dose atropine (0.05%), soft contact lenses with myopia control features, and orthokeratology lenses appear as promising options for managing myopia. The measures mentioned above are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and researchers are increasingly exploring their combined effects. By advocating for a personalized approach based on individual risk factors and the unique needs of each child, this review aims to contribute to the development of targeted and effective myopia prevention strategies, thereby minimizing the impact of myopia and its related complications among school-aged children in affected regions.\n"

      " Three cases of macular retinal detachment exacerbated during follow-up with myopic foveoschisis around myopic choroidal neovascularization.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and myopic traction maculopathy are major complications of pathologic myopia, and myopic foveoschisis (MF) is one of several symptoms that can be included under the general term \"myopic traction maculopathy\"; however, only a few cases will have MF around the myopic CNV. We report three cases with MF around myopic CNV that followed different clinical courses observed using swept-source optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "OBSERVATIONS: Case 1 was a 69-year-old woman with an axial length of 29.71 mm, myopic CNV, and MF in the left eye. One month after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR), a macular retinal detachment (RD) expanded. Vitrectomy and gas tamponade were performed during month 2; the macular RD and MF resolved gradually thereafter. Case 2 was a 54-year-old man with an axial length of 30.59 mm, myopic CNV, and MF in the right eye; after IVR, a macular RD developed and gradually expanded until month 4; the RD and MF resolved spontaneously and resolved during month 8. Case 3 was a 66-year-old woman with an axial length of 28.63 mm, myopic CNV, and MF in the left eye. A macular RD expanded 1 month after a previous vitrectomy for MF; after intravitreal injection of aflibercept, the macular RD and MF resolved gradually in month 12. In all cases, the CNV was accompanied by subretinal fluid, and two of the three cases had outer lamellar holes.\n",
      "CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE: The MF around the myopic CNV may lead to exacerbated MF and RD during follow-up, and the subretinal fluid caused by the CNV might facilitate MF progression. Since this condition is rare, further investigation of this entity is needed to determine appropriate management.\n"

      " Retro-mode: a newer insight into dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n",
      "The purpose of this study is to study the role of retro-mode (RM) in early detection and to compare it with other preexisting available modalities on multimodal imaging system in dry AMD. A prospective observational cross-sectional study was done between November 2020 and October 2021 which included 409 eyes of 207 patients. For study purpose, eyes were divided into 3 groups according to the size and number of the drusen, viz, group 1: No AMD, group 2: early AMD and group 3: intermediate AMD which was further divided into 2 subgroups, viz, subgroup A: eyes with drusen size 63-125 μm and subgroup B: eyes with drusen size 125-250 μm. Patients with active or treated wet AMD, scarred choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM), other maculopathies, other retinopathies, high myopia, trauma and glaucoma were excluded from the study. In cases of No AMD and early AMD, a number of drusens detected on RM were statistically not significant compared to fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and color photo (CF), but in intermediate AMD cases, it was statistically significant. While the area involved by drusens calculated by RM was statistically significant compared to both other modalities. When all modalities were compared with enhanced depth imaging-optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) at the choroid and chorio-capillary (CC) level and vessel density (VD) on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) at the choroid, capillaries, deep retinal and superficial retinal plexus level; it was only RM which was found to be in sync with these proven modalities in terms of pattern and trend. In the present scenario, RM is found to be a better diagnostic modality in detecting early and a greater number of drusens with area of involvement than other existing modalities. Though superior, as found in this study, this mode cannot replace other modalities at present but only acts as a complementary investigation in early detection of this disease.\n"

      " An auxiliary diagnostic tool for common fundus diseases based on fundus color photography and light-weight classification models.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of two lightweight neural network models in the diagnosis of common fundus diseases and make comparison to another two classical models.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 16,000 color fundus photography were collected, including 2000 each of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), high myopia, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), optic neuropathy, and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), in addition to 2000 normal fundus. Fundus photography was obtained from patients or physical examiners who visited the Ophthalmology Department of Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University. Each fundus photography has been diagnosed and labeled by two professional ophthalmologists. Two classical classification models (ResNet152 and DenseNet121), and two lightweight classification models (MobileNetV3 and ShufflenetV2), were trained. Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were used to evaluate the performance of the four models.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared with the classical classification model, the total size and number of parameters of the two lightweight classification models were significantly reduced, and the classification speed was sharply improved. Compared with the DenseNet121 model, the ShufflenetV2 model took 50.7% less time to make a diagnosis on a fundus photography. The classical models performed better than lightweight classification models, and Densenet121 showed highest AUC in five out of the seven common fundus diseases. However, the performance of lightweight classification models is satisfying. The AUCs using MobileNetV3 model to diagnose AMD, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, CRVO, high myopia, optic atrophy, and CSC were 0.805, 0.892, 0.866, 0.812, 0.887, 0.868, and 0.803, respectively. For ShufflenetV2model, the AUCs for the above seven diseases were 0.856, 0.893, 0.855, 0.884, 0.891, 0.867, and 0.844, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The training of light-weight neural network models based on color fundus photography for the diagnosis of common fundus diseases is not only fast but also has a significant reduction in storage size and parameter number compared with the classical classification model, and can achieve satisfactory accuracy.\n",

      " Shedding light on eye disease in obesity: A review.\n",
      "Obesity is known to be associated with numerous ocular manifestations, including but not limited to, diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, glaucoma, and dry eye disease. This review aims to provide an overview of the ophthalmological findings in obesity. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane databases for studies describing randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and observational studies published from 1 January 2017 to 1 April 2023. The search terms used included relevant keywords such as 'obesity', 'body mass index', 'waist-to-hip ratio', 'bariatric', 'ophthalmology', 'eye disease', 'myopia', 'retinopathy', 'glaucoma', and 'cataract'. This literature search was performed on 1 April 2023. Obesity is associated with increased risk of developing DR, a sight-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Similarly, obesity has been shown to increase risk of AMD, cataracts, glaucoma, and ocular surface disease. Multiple mechanisms linking obesity to ophthalmic disease have been proposed. Adipose tissue produces various inflammatory cytokines that can affect ocular tissues, leading to disease progression. Additionally, obesity is associated with systemic metabolic changes that can influence ocular health. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be protective against development of ophthalmic disease. Obesity is a significant risk factor for several ophthalmological diseases. Healthcare providers should encourage weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity to prevent or delay the onset of ocular complications. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this association, and to identify effective strategies for preventing or managing ophthalmic disease in patients with obesity.\n"

      " Management of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatment in France from 2008-2018: The Nationwide LANDSCAPE Study.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in French patients between 2008 and 2018.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal cohort study using exhaustive nationwide health records from the French National Health Information database. Enrollment criteria were adults aged ≥ 50 years, nAMD diagnosis, or reimbursement for nAMD treatments (anti-vascular epithelial growth factor [VEGF] injection or dynamic phototherapy with verteporfin). Exclusion criteria were high myopia, diagnosis of other retinal diseases, and treatments for other macular diseases (dexamethasone implant, laser). Main outcome measures were consumption of medical care and nAMD treatments per calendar year and number of years of follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2018, we identified 342,961 patients who have been treated for nAMD. Median duration of ophthalmological follow-up exceeded 7 years (90 months). The median annual number of ophthalmology consultations decreased from nine visits in year 1 after treatment initiation to four visits from year 7 onwards. The median duration of nAMD treatment was 10.1 months for all patients, with 48.5% of patients undergoing treatment for < 1 year. Only 24.4% of patients had maintained treatment at year 11. Patients remaining under treatment had a median of four anti-VEGF treatments per year throughout the 10-year study period. Ranibizumab was the more common first-line treatment (67.5% of patients) compared to aflibercept (32.4%). About 20% of patients who initiated treatment switched treatment at least once.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: LANDSCAPE provides exhaustive nationwide data on the real-world management of nAMD in France over a 10-year period. Further investigation into short treatment duration is required, especially in terms of understanding its relation to visual outcomes.\n"

      " Lesion detection with fine-grained image categorization for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) using optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) are retinal disorder caused by traction force on the macula, which can lead to varying degrees of vision loss in eyes with high myopia. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an effective imaging technique for diagnosing, detecting and classifying retinopathy. MTM has been classified into different patterns by OCT, corresponding to different clinical strategies.\n",
      "PURPOSE: We aimed to engineer a deep learning model that can automatically identify MTM in highly myopic (HM) eyes using OCT images.\n",
      "METHODS: A five-class classification model was developed using 2837 OCT images from 958 HM patients. We adopted a ResNet-34 architecture to train the model to identify MTM: no MTM (class 0), extra-foveal maculoschisis (class 1), inner lamellar macular hole (class 2), outer foveoschisis (class 3), and discontinuity or detachment of foveal outer hyperreflective layers (class 4). An independent test set of 604 images from 173 HM patients was used to evaluate the model's performance. Classification performance was assessed according to the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Our model exhibited a high training performance for classification (F1-score of 0.953; AUCs of 0.961 to 0.998). In test set, it achieved sensitivities (91.67%-97.78 %) and specificities (98.33%-99.17%) as good as, or better than, those of experienced clinicians. Heatmaps were generated to provide visual explanations.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We established a deep learning model for MTM classification using OCT images. This model performed equally well or better than retinal specialists and is suitable for large-scale screening and identifying MTM in HM eyes.\n"

      " Association Between Choroidal Thickness and Myopic Maculopathy in a Japanese Population: The Hisayama Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To examine the association between choroidal thickness and myopic maculopathy in a general Japanese population.\n",
      "DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2841 residents of a Japanese community aged ≥ 40 years, who consented to participate and had available data of choroidal thickness and fundus photographs, were enrolled in this study.\n",
      "METHODS: The choroidal thickness was measured by swept-source OCT. Participants were divided into quartiles of choroidal thickness. Myopic maculopathy was defined according to the classification system of the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group. Main outcome measures were odds ratios (ORs) of choroidal thickness for prevalent myopic maculopathy. The ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a logistic regression model.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalent myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eighty-one participants had myopic maculopathy (45 diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, 31 patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and 5 macular atrophy). Individuals in the lowest quartile of choroidal thickness had a significantly greater OR for the presence of myopic maculopathy than those in the highest quartile of choroidal thickness (OR: 4.78 [95% CI: 1.78-16.72]) after adjusting for confounders, including axial length. The sensitivity analysis among the 1176 myopic individuals with axial length of ≥ 24.0 mm also showed that thinner choroidal thickness was significantly associated with prevalent myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the significant inverse association between choroidal thickness and the likelihood of myopic maculopathy, suggesting that the measurement of choroidal thickness in addition to axial length would be useful for assessing the risk of myopic maculopathy and elucidating its pathogenesis.\n",

      "The toxicology of secondhand smoke (SHS), along with the harm of its exposure to human health, has been generally acknowledged; however, specific evidence is lacking on the association between SHS exposure and ocular health. In this systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022247992), we included 55 original articles published by 12 May 2023, which dealt with SHS exposure and ocular disorders, such as eye irritation, conjunctivitis, dry eye diseases, uveitis, myopia, astigmatism, contact lens discomfort, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and thyroid eye disease that addressed the ocular neurovascular structures of the macular, retinal nerve fiber layer, choroid, and corneal biomechanical parameters. We found compelling correlational evidence for eye irritation, conjunctivitis, and dry eye symptoms-supporting that SHS exposure was positively associated with inflammatory and allergic changes in the eyes. Yet, evidence about the associations between SHS exposure and other ocular disorders, structures, and parameters is still limited or controversial. Given the limitations of existing literature, more investigations with high quality and rigorous design are warranted to elucidate the potentially harmful effects of SHS exposure on ocular health.\n",

      " Maculopathies Referred to Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic as Optic Neuropathies: A Case Series.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The clinical features of maculopathies and optic neuropathies often overlap: Both present with decreased visual acuity and variable loss of color vision; thus, maculopathy can be misdiagnosed as optic neuropathy, leading to patient harm. We aimed to determine what findings and/or tests were most helpful in differentiating between optic neuropathy and maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective chart review of consecutive patients over 4.5 years who were referred to neuro-ophthalmology clinics with the diagnosis of optic neuropathy but whose final diagnosis was maculopathy. Patient demographics, mode of presentation, clinical profile, complete ophthalmological examination, results of all ancillary testing, and final diagnosis were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (27 women) were included. The median age was 55 years (range, 18-85). Most referrals were by ophthalmologists (72.3%) and optometrists (12.8%). The diagnosis of maculopathy was made in 51.1% of patients at the time of first neuro-ophthalmic consultation. Only 6.4% patients (3) had relative afferent pupillary defect. Benign disc anomalies (tilted, myopic, small, or anomalous discs) were present in 34.0%, and 21.3% had pathologic disc changes unrelated or secondary to maculopathy. Macular ocular coherence tomography (OCT) was abnormal in 84.4% (with outer retinal pathology in 42.2% and inner retina pathology in 17.8%). Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was normal in 82.6% of patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Macular OCT is a high-yield test in differentiating between optic neuropathy and maculopathy and should be obtained in patients with suspected optic neuropathies who have normal RNFL thickness. Macular dystrophies, particularly cone dystrophies, unspecified retinal disorders, and macular degeneration were the most common mimics of optic neuropathy. The diagnosis was often present on OCT of the macula. The presence of coexistent benign and pathological disc anomalies may lead to maculopathy being misdiagnosed as optic neuropathy.\n"

      " Research on classification method of high myopic maculopathy based on retinal fundus images and optimized ALFA-Mix active learning algorithm.\n",
      "AIM: To conduct a classification study of high myopic maculopathy (HMM) using limited datasets, including tessellated fundus, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and macular atrophy, and minimize annotation costs, and to optimize the ALFA-Mix active learning algorithm and apply it to HMM classification.\n",
      "METHODS: The optimized ALFA-Mix algorithm (ALFA-Mix+) was compared with five algorithms, including ALFA-Mix. Four models, including ResNet18, were established. Each algorithm was combined with four models for experiments on the HMM dataset. Each experiment consisted of 20 active learning rounds, with 100 images selected per round. The algorithm was evaluated by comparing the number of rounds in which ALFA-Mix+ outperformed other algorithms. Finally, this study employed six models, including EfficientFormer, to classify HMM. The best-performing model among these models was selected as the baseline model and combined with the ALFA-Mix+ algorithm to achieve satisfactory classification results with a small dataset.\n",
      "RESULTS: ALFA-Mix+ outperforms other algorithms with an average superiority of 16.6, 14.75, 16.8, and 16.7 rounds in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa value, respectively. This study conducted experiments on classifying HMM using several advanced deep learning models with a complete training set of 4252 images. The EfficientFormer achieved the best results with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa value of 0.8821, 0.8334, 0.9693, and 0.8339, respectively. Therefore, by combining ALFA-Mix+ with EfficientFormer, this study achieved results with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa value of 0.8964, 0.8643, 0.9721, and 0.8537, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The ALFA-Mix+ algorithm reduces the required samples without compromising accuracy. Compared to other algorithms, ALFA-Mix+ outperforms in more rounds of experiments. It effectively selects valuable samples compared to other algorithms. In HMM classification, combining ALFA-Mix+ with EfficientFormer enhances model performance, further demonstrating the effectiveness of ALFA-Mix+.\n"

      " Assessment of Ocular Deformation in Pathologic Myopia Using 3-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Ocular deformation in pathologic myopia can affect the entire globe. However, few studies have investigated the equatorial pattern of ocular shape. In addition, the correlation between equatorial and posterior morphology needs to be further explored.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To assess global ocular deformation in pathologic myopia.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This hospital-based, cross-sectional study included 180 pathologic myopic eyes with atrophic maculopathy grading C2 (diffuse chorioretinal atrophy) or more from 180 participants who underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including high-resolution 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, 10 nonpathologic myopic eyes of 10 participants were set as the control group.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: According to the cross-sectional view of equator, equatorial shape was classified as round, rectangular, pyriform (noncircular and more protruded in 1 direction), vertical-elliptical, or horizontal-elliptical; according to the nasal and inferior views, the posterior shape was categorized as spheroidal, conical, bulb-shaped, ellipsoidal, multidistorted, and barrel-shaped. Equatorial circularity and ocular sphericity were used to quantitatively assess the morphological variability of the equatorial and posterior regions, respectively. The association between ocular morphology and ocular parameters and myopic maculopathy was also investigated.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of 180 participants with pathologic myopia was 55.14 (10.74) years, 127 were female (70.6%), and the mean (SD) axial length of studied eyes was 30.22 (2.25) mm. The predominant equatorial shape was pyriform (66 eyes [36.7%]), followed by round (45 eyes [25.0%]). The predominant posterior shape was bulb-shaped (97 eyes [52.2%]), followed by multidistorted (46 eyes [24.7%]). Equatorial circularity and equatorial shapes were correlated (r = -0.469; 95% CI, -0.584 to -0.346; P < .001) and ocular sphericity was correlated with posterior shapes (r = -0.533; 95% CI, -0.627 to -0.427; P < .001). In eyes with a vertical-elliptical equator, equatorial circularity and ocular sphericity were positively linearly correlated (R2 = 0.246; 95% CI, 0.050-0.496; P = .002) and the prevalence of inferior staphyloma was higher (27.8%; P = .04). Eyes with a horizontal-elliptical equator have the most horizontally oriented axis of corneal flat keratometry (median, 43.55 [interquartile range, 43.84] degrees; P = .01) and tended to present with multidistorted posterior shape (21.7%; P = .04).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest ocular deformation is common in pathologic myopia and can affect the entire eye, including the equatorial and posterior regions. The morphological classification may enhance the understanding of the diverse patterns of ocular shape in pathologic myopia.\n"

      " Global prevalence of myopic macular degeneration in general population and patients with high myopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\n",
      "The prevalence of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in the general population and patients with high myopia worldwide has not been fully investigated. Therefore, we screened all population-based studies that reported the prevalence of MMD, and pooled prevalence of MMD using a random-effect model. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the differences in MMD prevalence in the general population and patients with high myopia according to ethnicity, region of residence (urban/rural), and grading system. Finally, 16 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Results obtained from 2,963 patients from seven countries on four continents indicated that the pooled prevalence of MMD in patients with high myopia was 49.0% (95% CI: 31.5%-66.7%). Results obtained from 71,052 participants from 10 countries on four continents suggested that the pooled prevalence of MMD in the general population was 1.7% (95% CI: 1.1%-2.6%). In the general population, living in urban areas and East Asians were associated with a high prevalence of MMD. Among patients with high myopia, only East Asians were at a higher risk of developing MMD. In conclusion, MMD was particularly prevalent in patients with high myopia. Compared with Europeans, East Asians (Chinese and Japanese) have a higher propensity of developing MMD, both in the general population and in patients with high myopia. It remains unclear whether the higher prevalence of MMD in patients with high myopia in East Asia is caused by differences in given age or given degree of myopia.Systematic review registration number: 202270014 (INPLASY.COM).\n"

      " Intravitreal panitumumab and myopic macular degeneration.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In experimental studies, intravitreally applied antibodies against epidermal growth factor (EGF), EGF family members (amphiregulin, neuregulin-1, betacellulin, epigen, epiregulin) and against the EGF receptor (EGFR) were associated with a reduction in lens-induced axial elongation and decrease in physiological eye elongation in guinea pigs and in non-human primates. Here, we investigated the intraocular tolerability and safety of a fully human monoclonal IgG2-antibody against EGFR, already in clinical use in oncology, as a potential future therapeutic approach for axial elongation in adult eyes with pathological myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: The clinical, monocentre, open-label, multiple-dose, phase-1 study included patients with myopic macular degeneration of stage 4, who received intravitreal injections of panitumumab in various doses and in intervals ranging between 2.1 months and 6.3 months.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 11 patients (age:66.8±6.3 years), receiving panitumumab injections in doses of 0.6 mg (4 eyes; 1×1 injection, 3×2 injections), 1.2 mg (4 eyes; 1×1 injection, 2×2 injections, 1×3 injections) and 1.8 mg (3 eyes; 1×1 injection, 2×2 injections), respectively. None of the participants showed treatment-emergent systemic adverse events or intraocular inflammatory reactions. Best-corrected visual acuity (1.62±0.47 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) vs 1.28±0.59 logMAR; p=0.08) and intraocular pressure (13.8±2.4 mm Hg vs 14.3±2.6 mm Hg; p=0.20) remained unchanged. In nine patients with a follow-up of >3 months (mean:6.7±2.7 months), axial length did not change significantly (30.73±1.03 mm vs 30.77±1.19 mm; p=0.56).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this open-labelled, phase-1 study with a mean follow-up of 6.7 months, panitumumab repeatedly administered intravitreally up to a dose of 1.8 mg was not associated with intraocular or systemic adverse effects. During the study period, axial length remained unchanged.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To report the cumulative incidence and risk factors of second eye involvement after diagnosis of myopic macular neovascularization (MNV) in the first eye.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of longitudinal data from a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Patients with high myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] ≤ - 6 diopters [D]), of European ethnicity, who were diagnosed with active MNV lesion in 1 eye between 2005 and 2018. Fellow eyes were free of MNV or macular atrophy at baseline, and data were collected on the SE, axial length, and presence of diffuse or patchy chorioretinal atrophy and lacquer cracks.\n",
      "METHODS: Incidence rate and 2-, 5-, and 10-year cumulative incidences were calculated; hazard ratios (HRs) of second eye involvement were analyzed for potential risk factors using Cox proportional hazard models.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Incidence of second eye involvement after onset of myopic MNV in the first eye.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included 88 patients over a period of 13 years with a mean age of 58 ± 15 years, mean axial length of 30 ± 1.7 mm and SE -14 ± 4 D at baseline. Twenty-four fellow eyes (27%) developed a myopic MNV during follow-up. This resulted in an incidence rate of 4.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-6.7) per 100 person-years and a cumulative incidence of 8%, 21%, and 38% at 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Mean time until MNV development in the fellow eye was 48 ± 37 months. Patients aged < 40 years at the initial presentation had a 3.8 times higher risk of bilateral myopic MNV (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.65-8.69; P = 0.002). The presence of lacquer cracks in the second eye seemed to increase risk, but this did not reach statistical significance (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 0.94-5.39; P = 0.07).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our study of high myopes of European descent shows very similar incidence rates for second eye myopic MNV compared with Asian studies. Our findings substantiate the importance for clinicians to monitor closely and create awareness, especially in younger patients.\n",

      " Multimodal Analysis on Clinical Characteristics of the Advanced Stage in Myopic Traction Maculopathy.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Here we investigate the clinical features of foveal detachment (FD), full-thickness macular hole (MH), and macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) in myopic traction maculopathy (MTM).\n",
      "METHODS: In the retrospective observational case series, 314 eyes of 198 patients with myopic retinoschisis in Beijing Tongren Hospital were enrolled. We recorded gender, age, and axial length and evaluated fundus characteristics using optical coherence tomography. Epiretinal membranes (ERMs), vitreoretinal traction, and paravascular abnormalities (PVAs) were used to describe the vitreoretinal interface condition. Different retinoschisis layers (inner, middle, and outer retinoschisis) and the location with a range of outer retinoschisis were evaluated to reveal the retinal condition. Five patterns of the scleral shape: dome-shaped, sloped toward the optic nerve, symmetrical or asymmetrical around the fovea, and irregular were assessed to show retina-sclera condition. We regarded the FD, full-thickness MH, and MHRD as the advanced stage in MTM. Multivariate logistic regression assessed significant factors for the advanced stage with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n",
      "RESULTS: There were 76 eyes with FD, 6 eyes with full-thickness MH, and 7 eyes with MHRD. The mean age was 52.9 ± 12.3 years. On univariate analysis, the eyes with the advanced stage were older and had higher rates of ERMs, PVAs, middle retinoschisis, outer retinoschisis, and irregular sclera shape. The number of retinoschisis layers and the grade of outer retinoschisis were higher in eyes with the advanced stage. After multivariate logistic regression, ERMs (OR 1.983; 95% CI 1.093-3.595; P = 0.024), middle retinoschisis (OR 2.967; 95% CI 1.630-5.401; P < 0.001), and higher grades of outer retinoschisis (OR 2.227; 95% CI 1.711-2.898; P < 0.001) remained associated with the advanced stage.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: ERMs, middle retinoschisis, and more extensive outer retinoschisis were significant characteristics of the advanced stage in MTM.\n",

      " COMPARISON OF THREE INTERNAL LIMITING MEMBRANE PEELING TECHNIQUES FOR MYOPIC TRACTION MACULOPATHY WITH HIGH RISK OF POSTOPERATIVE MACULAR HOLE DEVELOPMENT.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To compare three different internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling techniques, including standard ILM peeling, fovea-sparing ILM peeling, and inverted ILM flap (ILMF), in the treatment of myopic traction maculopathy with high risk of postoperative macular hole development.\n",
      "METHOD: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 101 eyes suffering from lamellar macular hole combined with myopic traction maculopathy in 98 consecutive patients who underwent vitrectomy with either standard ILM peeling, fovea-sparing ILM peeling, or ILMF from July 2017 to August 2020. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months after surgery. Best-corrected visual acuity, macular anatomical outcomes, and postoperative full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) formation were evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: No significant differences were found among the three surgical groups in baseline characteristics. 12 months after surgery, the mean best-corrected visual acuity was significantly improved ( P < 0.001) and showed no significant differences among groups ( P = 0.452). None of the eyes in the ILMF group, five eyes (15.6%) in the standard ILM peeling group, and six eyes (17.1%) in the fovea-sparing ILM peeling group developed a postoperative FTMH ( P = 0.026). Logistic regression showed that the ILM peeling technique was an independent influencing factor for FTMH formation (OR = 0.209, P = 0.014).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Compared with the standard ILM peeling or fovea-sparing ILM peeling technique, the ILMF technique resulted in similar visual outcomes but a relatively low incidence of postoperative FTMH in the treatment of lamellar macular hole combined with myopic traction maculopathy. Inverted ILM flap is an effective technique for treating myopic traction maculopathy with high risk of postoperative FTMH development.\n"

      " Presumed Unindicated Implantation of Posterior Chamber Phakic Intraocular Lens.\n",
      "BACKGROUND Refractive surgery is one of the most frequently performed ocular surgeries worldwide. Implantation of the posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens has advantages over laser vision correction, especially in high refractive error cases. We present a case of a young adult women with poor vision who underwent bilateral posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens explantation due to high vault, shallow anterior chambers, and a picture of cone-rod dystrophy. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old woman was referred for poor vision following an implantation of bilateral toric implantable collamer lens (ICL) implantation when she was 18 years old for high myopic astigmatism and anisometropia. On presentation, the best corrected visual acuity was 4-6/200 and 2-3/200 in the right eye and left eye, respectively. Slit lamp examination indicated a clear cornea with pigment deposition on the endothelium, high ICL vault, shallow anterior chamber, and bowing of the iris bilaterally. The patient underwent bilateral removal of the ICLs on separate visits, yet the vision remained unchanged. Diagnostics revealed that the patient had bull's eye maculopathy with atrophy due to her cone-rod dystrophy, which caused the poor vision. CONCLUSIONS This report emphasizes the need for careful and appropriate patient and intraocular size selection for refractive surgery. It indicates the importance of thorough medical examination, including genetic testing, fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography when retinal dystrophy is suspected. Generally, close follow-up is crucial in the setting of high vaulting following ICL implantation to prevent secondary complications.\n",

      " Influence of posterior staphyloma in myopic maculopathy and visual prognosis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Posterior staphyloma is a hallmark of high myopia and its presence associates to greater degrees of myopic maculopathy. Nonetheless, its development, repercussion on visual function and relationship with maculopathy components, is still unclear. The objective was to analyze the impact of posterior staphyloma on the incidence and severity of myopic maculopathy and its repercussion on visual prognosis.\n",
      "SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted on 473 consecutive eyes of 259 highly myopic patients examined at Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda University Hospital (Madrid, Spain). All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), axial length (AL), myopic maculopathy classification according to ATN system (atrophic/traction/neovascularization), determined the presence of posterior staphyloma, pathologic myopia (PM) and severe PM. Multimodal imaging were performed including fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT-angiography, fundus autofluorescence and/ or fluorescein angiography.\n",
      "RESULTS: Out of the total, 70.65% were female patients (n = 173/259), mean BCVA was 0.41 ± 0.54 logMAR units and mean AL was 29.3 ± 2.6 mm (26-37.6). Posterior staphyloma was present in 69.4% of eyes. Eyes with posterior staphyloma compared to non-staphyloma were older (p < 0.05), had greater AL (p < 0.01), worse BCVA (p < 0.01) and higher stage in ATN components (p < 0.01). Moreover, compound subgroup showed worse BCVA (p < 0.01) and greater stage in each of the ATN components (p < 0.01). Staphylomas with macular involvement presented worse BCVA (p < 0.01), higher AL (p < 0.01), and greater ATN (p < 0.05). The risk of posterior staphyloma presence in eyes with PM and severe PM eyes was 89.8% and 96.7%, respectively. Posterior staphyloma was the best predictor for BCVA in myopic patients (p < 0.01).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Posterior staphyloma's presence determines high risk of myopic maculopathy and therefore worse visual prognosis, especially those with macular involvement. Posterior staphyloma represented the best predictor for BCVA in highly myopic patients.\n"

      "RESULTS: We included a total of 193 eyes (193 patients) in this study; 136 eyes (70%) treated with tamponade were compared with 57 eyes (30%) treated without tamponade. Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. Both groups showed significant visual improvement at 12 months (both P < .001). However, postoperative visual acuity and visual improvement at 12 months were significantly better (P = .003 and P = .028, respectively) in eyes without tamponade, although the MTM in these eyes without tamponade took longer to resolve (P = .039). Retinal thickness and the ellipsoid zone were more preserved in eyes without tamponade (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). Complications such as macular holes did not differ between the groups. A novel imaging finding of \"schisis bending (accordioning)\" was identified during MTM resolution.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy either with or without tamponade for MTM was effective in improving vision in this study. However, eyes without tamponade experienced even better visual improvement and preserved retinal anatomy, despite a longer schisis resolution time.

Three patterns of atrophy were identified: multiple-atrophic pattern, 63% of the eyes had small atrophies occurring at multiple sites around the MNV edge; single-atrophic pattern, 18.5% had atrophies occurring only on one side of the MNV edge; and exudation-related pattern, 18.5% had atrophy occurring within a previous serous exudation or hemorrhagic area and slightly away from the MNV edge. Eyes with atrophies in multiple-atrophic and exudation-related patterns progressed to large macular atrophies involving the central fovea and showed decrease in best-corrected visual acuity during the 3-year follow-up period. Eyes with single-atrophic pattern had a sparing of the fovea and had good recovery of the best-corrected visual acuity.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: There are three patterns of MNV-related atrophy in eyes with pathologic myopia with different courses of progression.\n"

      "OBJECTIVES: To conduct an external validation of an automated artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic system using fundus photographs from a real-life multicentre cohort.\n",
      "METHODS: We designed external validation in multiple scenarios, consisting of 3049 images from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China (QHSDU, validation dataset 1), 7495 images from three other hospitals in China (validation dataset 2), and 516 images from high myopia (HM) population of QHSDU (validation dataset 3). The corresponding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of this AI diagnostic system to identify glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) were calculated.\n",
      "RESULTS: In validation datasets 1 and 2, the algorithm yielded accuracy of 93.18% and 91.40%, area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) of 95.17% and 96.64%, and significantly higher sensitivity of 91.75% and 91.41%, respectively, compared to manual graders. On the subsets complicated with retinal comorbidities, such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration, in validation datasets 1 and 2, the algorithm achieved accuracy of 87.54% and 93.81%, and AUC of 97.02% and 97.46%, respectively. In validation dataset 3, the algorithm achieved comparable accuracy of 81.98% and AUC of 87.49%, with a sensitivity of 83.61% and specificity of 81.76% on GON recognition specifically in the HM population.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: With acceptable generalization capability across varying levels of image quality, different clinical centres, or certain retinal comorbidities, such as HM, the automatic AI diagnostic system had the potential to provide expert-level glaucoma detection.\n"

      "METHODS: Retrospective, observational case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: patients with mCNV treated with bevacizumab or ranibizumab injections. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were collected at baseline, after 3, 6, 12, 24 months and the last visit.\n",

      "AIMS: To investigate myopic maculopathy in Chinese children with high myopia and its association with choroidal and retinal changes.\n",
      "METHODS: This cross-sectional study included Chinese children aged 4-18 years with high myopia. Myopic maculopathy was classified by fundus photography and retinal thickness (RT) and choroidal thickness (ChT) in the posterior pole were measured by swept-source optical coherence tomography. A receiver operation curve was used to determine the efficacy of fundus factors in classifying myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, 579 children aged 12.8±3.2 years with a mean spherical equivalent of -8.44±2.20 D were included. The proportions of tessellated fundus and diffuse chorioretinal atrophy were 43.52% (N=252) and 8.64% (N=50), respectively. Tessellated fundus was associated with a thinner macular ChT (OR=0.968, 95% CI: 0.961 to 0.975, p<0.001) and RT (OR=0.977, 95% CI: 0.959 to 0.996, p=0.016), longer axial length (OR=1.545, 95% CI: 1.198 to 1.991, p=0.001) and older age (OR=1.134, 95% CI: 1.047 to 1.228, p=0.002) and less associated with male children (OR=0.564, 95% CI: 0.348 to 0.914, p=0.020). Only a thinner macular ChT (OR=0.942, 95% CI: 0.926 to 0.959, p<0.001) was independently associated with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy. When using nasal macular ChT for classifying myopic maculopathy, the optimal cut-off value was 129.00 µm (area under the curve (AUC)=0.801) and 83.85 µm (AUC=0.910) for tessellated fundus and diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, respectively.\n",

      " Profile of Patients Treated with Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Injections in Bhutan.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Ocular vascular diseases are common causes of visual impairment and blindness, for which anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is the first-line therapy. Current study describes the profile of patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (IVI), and gender variation in Bhutan. The study was designed to inform national health policy.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.\n",
      "METHODS: We reviewed the surgical registers of the vitreoretinal (VR) units across Bhutan over three years. Patient demography, clinical findings, diagnostic tests performed, and diagnoses or indications for IVI were logged. A descriptive analysis was performed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Despite limited availability of anti-VEGF, a total of 381 patients received IVI in operating theatres as mandated by the national guidelines. The majority of patients were males (230, 60.4%, p = 0.004). The mean age was 65.2 ± 13.5 years (range 13 years to 90 years), and a median of 69 years. The majority of the treated eyes (117, 30.7%) had BCVA <3/60 to light perception (PL), and another 51 eyes (13.4%) had < 6/60 to 3/60. The most common indication for IVI was neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) (168 cases, 42.2%), followed by retinal vein occlusion (RVO) (132 cases, 34.6%), diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and retinopathy (DR) (50 cases, 13.1%), and myopic choroidal neovascular membrane (11 cases, 0.03%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Limited human resources for managing VR diseases in Bhutan are compounded by economic and geographic challenges. With increasing VR diseases such as nAMD and myopia and complications of systemic diseases such as DR, DMO and RVO, there is a need to improve VR services. Currently, anti-VEGF is procured only for a pooled patients requiring IVI, and patients are lost due to longer waiting periods. Bhutan needs to assess if females are reporting less or are not receiving treatment due to cultural barriers and social stigma.\n"

      " Sociodemographic disparities in ophthalmological clinical trials.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: In ophthalmology, clinical trials (CTs) guide the treatment of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, myopia, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and keratoconus with distinct presentations, pathological characteristics and responses to treatment in minority populations.Reporting gender and race and ethnicity in healthcare studies is currently recommended by National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines to ensure representativeness and generalisability; however, CT results that include this information have been limited in the past 30 years.The objective of this review is to analyse the sociodemographic disparities in ophthalmological phases III and IV CT based on publicly available data.\n",
      "METHODS: This study included phases III and IV complete ophthalmological CT available from clinicaltrials.org, and describes the country distribution, race and ethnicity description and gender, and funding characteristics.\n",
      "RESULTS: After a screening process, we included 654 CTs, with findings that corroborate the previous CT reviews' findings that most ophthalmological participants are white and from high-income countries. A description of race and ethnicity is reported in 37.1% of studies but less frequently included within the most studied ophthalmological specialty area (cornea, retina, glaucoma and cataracts). The incidence of race and ethnicity reporting has improved during the past 7 years.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Although NIH and FDA promote guidelines to improve generalisability in healthcare studies, the inclusion of race and ethnicity in publications and diverse participants in ophthalmological CT is still limited. Actions from the research community and related stakeholders are necessary to increase representativeness and guarantee generalisability in ophthalmological research results to optimise care and reduce related healthcare disparities.\n"

      " Evidence of vascular involvement in myopia: a review.\n",
      "The benign public perception of myopia (nearsightedness) as a visual inconvenience masks the severity of its sight-threatening consequences. Myopia is a significant risk factor for posterior pole conditions such as maculopathy, choroidal neovascularization and glaucoma, all of which have a vascular component. These associations strongly suggest that myopic eyes might experience vascular alterations prior to the development of complications. Myopic eyes are out of focus because they are larger in size, which in turn affects their overall structure and function, including those of the vascular beds. By reviewing the vascular changes that characterize myopia, this review aims to provide an understanding of the gross, cellular and molecular alterations identified at the structural and functional levels with the goal to provide an understanding of the latest evidence in the field of experimental and clinical myopia vascular research. From the evidence presented, we hypothesize that the interaction between excessive myopic eye growth and vascular alterations are tipping-points for the development of sight-threatening changes.\n",

      " Macular Retinoschisis from Optic Disc without a Visible Optic Pit or Advanced Glaucomatous Cupping (No Optic Pit Retinoschisis [NOPIR]).\n",
      "PURPOSE: To review eyes with peripapillary and macular retinoschisis without a visible optic pit or advanced glaucomatous optic atrophy, or No Optic Pit Retinoschisis (NOPIR).\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter case series.\n",
      "SUBJECTS: The study included 11 eyes of 11 patients.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective study of eyes with macular retinoschisis without a visible optic pit, advanced optic nerve head cupping, or macular leakage on fluorescein angiography.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity (VA), retinoschisis resolution, months to resolution, and recurrence of retinoschisis RESULTS: The mean age was 68.1 ± 17.6 years, mean intraocular pressure was 17.4 ± 3.8 mmHg, and the mean spherical equivalent refractive error was -3.1 ± 2.9 diopters. No subject had pathologic myopia. Seven subjects were treated for glaucoma, and 9 subjects had nerve fiber layer defects on OCT. All eyes had retinoschisis in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the nasal macula and extending to the edge of the optic disc, and 8 subjects had fovea-involving retinoschisis. Three nonfoveal and 4 fovea-involved eyes were observed, and 4 fovea-involved eyes with vision loss underwent surgery. Surgery involved preoperative juxtapapillary laser followed by vitrectomy and membrane and internal limiting membrane peeling with intraocular gas and face-down position. The mean baseline VA was significantly worse in the surgery group than that in the observation group (P = 0.020). Retinoschisis resolved and vision improved in all surgical cases. The mean resolution time for the surgery group was 2.75 ± 0.96 months, which was shorter than that for the observation group (28.0 ± 21.2 months; P = 0.014). No eye developed recurrence of the retinoschisis after surgery.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Peripapillary and macular retinoschisis can develop in eyes without a visible optic pit or advanced glaucomatous cupping. Eyes without foveal involvement and those with foveal involvement but only mild decrease in vision can be observed for spontaneous resolution. If there is persistent foveal involvement with vision loss, surgery can improve vision by resolving the macular retinoschisis. Surgery for fovea-involved macular retinoschisis without a visible optic pit resulted in faster anatomic resolution and better vision recovery.\n",

      "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among the elderly, and there is currently no clinical treatment targeting the primary impairment of AMD. The earliest clinical hallmark of AMD is drusen, which are yellowish spots mainly composed of lipid droplets (LDs) accumulated under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). However, the potential pathogenic role of this excessive LD accumulation in AMD is yet to be determined, partially due to a lack of chemical tools to manipulate LDs specifically. Here, we employed our recently developed Lipid Droplets·AuTophagy Tethering Compounds (LD∙ATTECs) to degrade LDs and to evaluate its consequence on the AMD-like phenotypes in apoe\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Premature birth and the postnatal occurrence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are the main risk factors for reduced visual acuity and blindness in childhood and adolescence accompanied by numerous morphological ocular changes.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: It can be assumed that these alterations persist throughout life and could represent a potential risk factor for ocular diseases, although little is known to date about the long-term effects of prematurity on ocular function and morphology in adulthood.\n",
      "METHODS: The aim of the present study is to review the literature on the long-term effects of prematurity and associated factors.\n",
      "RESULTS: Individuals born preterm exhibit reduced visual acuity, lower visual quality of life, and steeper corneal configuration in adulthood. Furthermore, individuals with advanced ROP and need for ROP treatment are at particularly high risk for myopic refractive error, the occurrence of strabismus, and increased lens opacities with thicker lenses. Low gestational age is associated with thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness as well as thicker foveal retinal thickness and more frequent occurrence of foveal hypoplasia. In addition, data from the Gutenberg Health Study showed that low birth weight as a surrogate marker for prematurity and fetal growth restriction are associated with an increased prevalence of age-related macular degeneration as well as more frequently with diabetes and consequently diabetic retinopathy.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Premature birth and associated factors lead to life-long functional and morphological ocular changes. There is evidence that this can lead to retinal diseases later in life and thus, there appear to be fetal origins for adult eye disease. This may have implications for ophthalmic controls and its intervals in adulthood.\n"

      " Isolation of Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells from Guinea Pig Eyes.\n",
      "This protocol describes the isolation of cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from the eyes of young pigmented guinea pigs for potential application in molecular biology studies, including gene expression analyses. In the context of eye growth regulation and myopia, the RPE likely plays a role as a cellular relay for growth modulatory signals, as it is located between the retina and the two walls of the eye, such as the choroid and sclera. While protocols for isolating the RPE have been developed for both chicks and mice, these protocols have proven not to be directly translatable to the guinea pig, which has become an important and widely used mammalian myopia model. In this study, molecular biology tools were used to examine the expression of specific genes to confirm that the samples were free of contamination from the adjacent tissues. The value of this protocol has already been demonstrated in an RNA-Seq study of RPE from young pigmented guinea pigs exposed to myopia-inducing optical defocus. Beyond eye growth regulation, this protocol has other potential applications in studies of retinal diseases, including myopic maculopathy, one of the leading causes of blindness in myopes, in which the RPE has been implicated. The main advantage of this technique is that it is relatively simple and once perfected, yields high-quality RPE samples suitable for molecular biology studies, including RNA analysis.\n"

      " Visual Acuity\n",
      "None: A visual acuity test is only one part of a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. The goal of the visual acuity test is to determine clarity or sharpness of vision. Visual acuity testing examines a patient's ability to distinguish different optotypes (recognizable letters or symbols) at a standard distance. This process requires many functioning pathways, including light reaching the retina with appropriate refraction, the retina's health, and the downstream capacity to transfer and interpret the visual stimuli. In the 1800s, there was a move to standardize visual testing, which led to the formation of several visual acuity charts with different optotypes. The first and still most widely used today is the Snellen chart. Other testing charts developed around that time include the Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart, and Allen chart. More recently, the LogMAR chart (also known as ETDRS chart) has gained favor. The LogMAR chart provides more accurate results when compared to other visual acuity charts, and the results are more easily used in vision analysis, making it the preferred chart in clinical studies. The results of visual acuity are classically reported using 20/20 (6/6 when using meters) for standard vision. The numerator describes the distance from the chart, typically 20 ft (6 m). The denominator describes the distance that an individual with normal vision (20/20 vision) can read the same line on the chart. For example, an individual with 20/60 vision would be able to distinguish the same optotype at 20 ft that another individual with normal (20/20) vision distinguishes at 60 ft. In the logMAR, visual acuity is reported as a single number where 0.0 is standard vision. Visual acuity decreases as the number increases and improves as the number decreases. Although 20/20 visual acuity has been referred to as \"perfect vision,\" it is important to remember that this is only one aspect of vision and does not include other elements such as depth perception, peripheral vision, and colorblindness. There are many reasons that an individual could have an altered visual acuity. One of the most common causes of altered vision is a refractive error, such as myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness). Additional causes of visual impairment include astigmatism, amblyopia, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, ischemia, cataracts, glaucoma, corneal abrasion, or other traumatic injuries. Visual acuity testing is essential as many of these factors can be benefited from early intervention. It is crucial to determine an individual's best-corrected visual acuity. The WHO describes individuals with low vision as having a best-corrected vision of 20/60 or worse, and blind as best corrected vision worse than 20/400, whereas legal blindness is identified as 20/200 in the United States. These formal definitions can have ramifications when it comes to accommodations and abilities to operate a motor vehicle.\n",

      " Macular Sling: A Customizable Method for Macular Buckling using Available Elements.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Macular buckling surgery is used to treat certain cases of myopic traction maculopathy but is rarely performed in the United States. One of the main factors limiting its use is the lack of commercially available buckling elements. Here we describe a novel technique for creating an effective macular buckle using readily obtainable buckling materials.\n",
      "METHODS: By using a traditional circumferential 41 band as the anchoring point around the globe, a 240 band can then be attached and oriented posteriorly along the superonasal-infertemporal axis. This posterior 240 band is then used to guide a grooved sponge (509G) under the macula to create a customizable and titratable tamponade effect along the posterior pole. This approach was used to provide external support in the case of a recurrent, complex tractional retinal detachment which had failed multiple prior vitrectomy-based repairs.\n",
      "RESULTS: Placement of the macular sling resolved the patient's recurrent retinal detachment with return of visual acuity to her pre-operative baseline. There have been no adverse effects related to the surgery aside from a large hyperopic shift due to the buckle effect on the macula. We believe the technical and material complexity of this technique is comparable to that of more common scleral buckling techniques.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This macular sling technique can be used to create an effective posterior buckle without requiring specialized materials.\n"

      " Domain Adaptation-Based Automated Detection of Retinal Diseases from Optical Coherence Tomography Images.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To verify the effectiveness of domain adaptation in generalizing a deep learning-based anomaly detection model to unseen optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.\n",
      "METHODS: Two datasets (source and target, where labelled training data was only available for the source) captured by two different OCT facilities were collected to train the model. We defined the model containing a feature extractor and a classifier as Model One and trained it with only labeled source data. The proposed domain adaptation model was defined as Model Two, which has the same feature extractor and classifier as Model One but has an additional domain critic in the training phase. We trained the Model Two with both the source and target datasets; the feature extractor was trained to extract domain-invariant features while the domain critic learned to capture the domain discrepancy. Finally, a well-trained feature extractor was used to extract domain-invariant features and a classifier was used to detect images with retinal pathologies in the two domains.\n",
      "RESULTS: The target data consisted of 3,058 OCT B-scans captured from 163 participants. Model One achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.912 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.895-0.962], while Model Two achieved an overall AUC of 0.989 [95% CI, 0.982-0.993] for detecting pathological retinas from healthy samples. Moreover, Model Two achieved an average retinopathies detection accuracy of 94.52%. Heat maps showed that the algorithm focused on the area with pathological changes during processing, similar to manual grading in daily clinical work.\n",

      " Post-vitrectomy secondary macular holes: Risk factors, clinical features, and multivariate analysis of outcome predictors.\n",
      "PURPOSE: We report clinical characteristics, risk factors, treatment outcomes, and prognostic predictors of post-vitrectomy secondary macular holes (MHs).\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective observational case series from November 2014 to December 2020. Eyes that developed secondary MH, two weeks and beyond after primary vitrectomy for non-MH indications, were enrolled. Pre- and intraoperative records were screened to exclude pre-existence of MH. Eyes with multiple vitreoretinal surgeries prior to MH detection and tractional myopic maculopathy were excluded.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 29 eyes of 29 patients with a mean age of 52 years developed secondary MH post-vitrectomy. The most common indications for primary vitrectomy were rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD, 48.2%) and tractional retinal detachment (TRD, 24.1%). Time to MH detection after primary vitrectomy was 91.5 ± 117.6 days. The mean minimum hole diameter was 530 ± 298 microns. Epi-retinal membrane and cystoid degeneration was noted in 6 (20.7%) and 12 (41.3%) eyes, respectively (p = 0.088). The mean time from MH detection to MH repair was 34 ± 42 days. The surgical intervention included internal limiting membrane peeling with tamponade in 25 eyes. Overall, 80% showed anatomic hole closure, 90.9% versus 57.1% in the RRD and TRD (p = 0.092), respectively. The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the final visit was 0.71 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution. Thirteen eyes (52%) had a BCVA of 20/100 or better. Minimal hole diameter (p = 0.029) only predicted final visual acuity. The interval between MH diagnosis and repair did not affect hole closure significantly (p = 0.064).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Secondary MH post-vitrectomy closed successfully with limited visual improvement and trails behind idiopathic MH.\n"

      " Correlation of Visual Acuity and Outer Retinal Thickness in Myopic Atrophic Maculopathy: A Retrospective Review.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Myopic atrophic maculopathy is prevalent among patients with pathologic myopia and frequently leads to relentless vision loss. Several grading systems were established to facilitate the understanding of myopic atrophic maculopathy. However, the anatomical details in different stages of myopic maculopathy are so far not clearly elucidated. This study aims to investigate the visual acuity and retinal sublayer features in highly myopic eyes with varying severities of myopic atrophic maculopathy (MAM).\n",
      "METHODS: The clinical records of 111 consecutive patients (158 eyes) with high myopia (refractive error ≤ -6.0 D and axial length ≥ 26.0 mm) were reviewed. Fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured. MAM was graded according to the META-analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification system. Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and dome-shaped macula (DSM) were also investigated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 158 eyes, 18 (11%), 21(13%), 24 (15%), 25 (16%), 23 (15%), and 24 (15%) had tessellated fundus, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with DSM, patchy atrophy, patchy atrophy with DSM, and MAM with mCNV, respectively. A total of 23 (15%) eyes had macular atrophy without mCNV. Progressive thinning in the Henle's fiber and outer nuclear layers, myoid and ellipsoid zone (MEZ), outer segment (OS), and interdigitation zone and retinal pigmented epithelium based on the severity of MAM (p-value < 0.001) was found. MEZ and OS were most significantly reduced in thickness (p-value < 0.001). The presence of mCNV demonstrated significant outer retinal layer thinning compared with that of the tessellated fundus (p-value = 0.031). Patchy atrophy with DSM showed statistically poorer BCVA compared with that without (p-value = 0.008).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Visual acuity and outer retinal sublayer characteristics were correlated with the severity of MAM. Outer retinal sublayer analysis by spectrum-domain OCT shed some light on the mechanisms of MAM progression.\n",

      " A nonsense mutation in C8orf37 linked with retinitis pigmentosa, early macular degeneration, cataract, and myopia in an arRP family from North India.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at identifying the underlying genetic defect in a consanguineous autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) (RP-1175) family having RP with early macular degeneration, cataract, and myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the DNA of the proband, and variants observed were validated in the rest of the affected and unaffected family members by Sanger sequencing. Different bioinformatics tools were applied to access the pathogenicity of the observed variant.\n",
      "RESULTS: A nonsense mutation i.e., c.555G > A (p.Trp185Ter) in C8orf37 in homozygous form, has been identified that segregated with the disease in the affected members. c.555G > A was absent in unaffected family members and in 107 ethnically matched controls, therefore ruling out its possibility of being a polymorphism.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Present study identifies a nonsense mutation (c.555G > A) at codon 185 in C8orf37 linked with arRP, early macular degeneration, posterior subcapsular cataract, and myopia. The identical mutation has previously been reported in a Pakistani family with isolated RP and in a Chinese family with RP and macular degeneration. This variable expressivity of the identified mutation c.555G > A in C8orf37 in the analyzed Indian family may be attributed to the presence of the modifier alleles. Also, Trp185 might be a mutation hotspot in Asian arRP patients and in the future, p.Trp185Ter in C8orf37 may be tested during initial screening in arRP cases especially belonging to a similar population.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To propose a five-category model for the automatic detection of myopic macular lesions to help grassroots medical institutions conduct preliminary screening of myopic macular lesions from limited number of color fundus images.\n",
      "METHODS: First, 1,750 fundus images of non-myopic retinal lesions and four categories of pathological myopic maculopathy were collected, graded, and labeled. Subsequently, three five-classification models based on Vision Outlooker for Visual Recognition (VOLO), EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 for detecting myopic maculopathy were trained with data-augmented images, and the diagnostic results of the different trained models were compared and analyzed. The main evaluation metrics were sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), area under the curve (AUC), kappa and accuracy, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).\n",
      "RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of the VOLO-D2 model was 96.60% with a kappa value of 95.60%. All indicators used for the diagnosis of myopia-free macular degeneration were 100%. The sensitivity, NPV, specificity, and PPV for diagnosis of leopard fundus were 96.43, 98.33, 100, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the diagnosis of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy were 96.88, 98.59, 93.94, and 99.29%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the diagnosis of patchy chorioretinal atrophy were 92.31, 99.26, 97.30, and 97.81%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the diagnosis of macular atrophy were 100, 98.10, 84.21, and 100%, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The VOLO-D2 model accurately identified myopia-free macular lesions and four pathological myopia-related macular lesions with high sensitivity and specificity. It can be used in screening pathological myopic macular lesions and can help ophthalmologists and primary medical institution providers complete the initial screening diagnosis of patients.\n"

We aimed to derive an improved polygenic score (PGS) for predicting children at risk of HM and to test if a PGS is predictive of MMD after accounting for SER.\n",
      "METHODS: The PGS was derived from genome-wide association studies in participants of UK Biobank, CREAM Consortium, and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging. MMD severity was quantified by a deep learning algorithm. Prediction of HM was quantified as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Prediction of severe MMD was assessed by logistic regression.\n",
      "FINDINGS: In independent samples of European, African, South Asian and East Asian ancestry, the PGS explained 19% (95% confidence interval 17-21%), 2% (1-3%), 8% (7-10%) and 6% (3-9%) of the variation in SER, respectively. The AUROC for HM in these samples was 0.78 (0.75-0.81), 0.58 (0.53-0.64), 0.71 (0.69-0.74) and 0.67 (0.62-0.72), respectively. The PGS was not associated with the risk of MMD after accounting for SER: OR = 1.07 (0.92-1.24).\n",

      " A systematic review: Virtual-reality-based techniques for human exercises and health improvement.\n",
      "Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a new safe and efficient tool for the rehabilitation of many childhood and adulthood illnesses. VR-based therapies have the potential to improve both motor and functional skills in a wide range of age groups through cortical reorganization and the activation of various neuronal connections. Recently, the potential for using serious VR-based games that combine perceptual learning and dichoptic stimulation has been explored for the rehabilitation of ophthalmological and neurological disorders. In ophthalmology, several clinical studies have demonstrated the ability to use VR training to enhance stereopsis, contrast sensitivity, and visual acuity. The use of VR technology provides a significant advantage in training each eye individually without requiring occlusion or penalty. In neurological disorders, the majority of patients undergo recurrent episodes (relapses) of neurological impairment, however, in a few cases (60-80%), the illness progresses over time and becomes chronic, consequential in cumulated motor disability and cognitive deficits. Current research on memory restoration has been spurred by theories about brain plasticity and findings concerning the nervous system's capacity to reconstruct cellular synapses as a result of interaction with enriched environments. Therefore, the use of VR training can play an important role in the improvement of cognitive function and motor disability. Although there are several reviews in the community employing relevant Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, VR has not yet been thoroughly examined in this regard. In this systematic review, we examine the key ideas of VR-based training for prevention and control measurements in ocular diseases such as Myopia, Amblyopia, Presbyopia, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Epilepsy and Autism spectrum disorder. This review highlights the fundamentals of VR technologies regarding their clinical research in healthcare. Moreover, these findings will raise community awareness of using VR training and help researchers to learn new techniques to prevent and cure different diseases. We further discuss the current challenges of using VR devices, as well as the future prospects of human training.\n"

      " Performance analysis of pretrained convolutional neural network models for ophthalmological disease classification.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the classification performance of pretrained convolutional neural network models or architectures using fundus image dataset containing eight disease labels.\n",
      "METHODS: A publicly available ocular disease intelligent recognition database has been used for the diagnosis of eight diseases. This ocular disease intelligent recognition database has a total of 10,000 fundus images from both eyes of 5,000 patients for the following eight diseases: healthy, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, hypertension, myopia, and others. Ocular disease classification performances were investigated by constructing three pretrained convolutional neural network architectures including VGG16, Inceptionv3, and ResNet50 models with adaptive moment optimizer. These models were implemented in Google Colab, which made the task straight-forward without spending hours installing the environment and supporting libraries. To evaluate the effectiveness of the models, the dataset was divided into 70%, 10%, and 20% for training, validation, and testing, respectively. For each classification, the training images were augmented to 10,000 fundus images.\n",
      "RESULTS: ResNet50 achieved an accuracy of 97.1%; sensitivity, 78.5%; specificity, 98.5%; and precision, 79.7%, and had the best area under the curve and final score to classify cataract (area under the curve = 0.964, final score = 0.903). By contrast, VGG16 achieved an accuracy of 96.2%; sensitivity, 56.9%; specificity, 99.2%; precision, 84.1%; area under the curve, 0.949; and final score, 0.857.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the ability of the pretrained convolutional neural network architectures to identify ophthalmological diseases from fundus images. ResNet50 can be a good architecture to solve problems in disease detection and classification of glaucoma, cataract, hypertension, and myopia; Inceptionv3 for age-related macular degeneration, and other disease; and VGG16 for normal and diabetic retinopathy.\n"

      "INTRODUCTION: To investigate changes in the vitreoretinal interface after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: Eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) treated with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF in a single-center were retrospectively reviewed. Fundus abnormalities and features of optical computed tomography were studied.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 295 eyes from 254 patients were recruited to the study. Prevalence of myopic macular retinoschisis (MRS) was 25.4%, and the rates of progression and onset of MRS were 75.9% and 16.2%, respectively. Outer retinal schisis (β = 8.586, p = 0.003) and lamellar macular hole (LMH) (β = 5.015, p = 0.043) at baseline were identified risk factors for progression and onset of MRS, whereas male sex (β = 9.000, p = 0.039) and outer retinal schisis at baseline (β = 5.250, p = 0.010) were risk factors for MRS progression. Progression of MRS was first detected in outer retinal layers in 48.3% of eyes. Thirteen eyes required surgical intervention. Spontaneous improvements of MRS were observed in five eyes (6.3%).\n",

      " What Should We Pay More Attention to Marfan Syndrome Expecting Ectopia Lentis: Incidence and Risk Factors of Retinal Manifestations.\n",
      "(1) Background: This paper investigates the incidence and risk factors of retinal manifestations in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) in a Chinese cohort. (2) Methods: This is a population-based cross-sectional study. In total, 344 eyes (172 MFS participants) were enrolled, each of whom underwent a detailed ocular examination. B-scan ultrasonography, ultra-wide-angle fundus images and optical coherence tomography images were conducted to assess posterior staphyloma, types of retinal damages and maculopathy. (3) Results: MFS patients have a high proportion (32.5%) of maculopathy, among which atrophy is the most common type (27.6%). Compared with participants without maculopathy, participants with maculopathy had a longer axial length (AL), higher incidence of posterior staphyloma, macular split and retinal detachment (RD) (\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term progression pattern of myopic tractional maculopathy and the risk factors.\n",
      "METHODS: The prevalence and grade of myopic tractional maculopathy were assessed with optical coherence tomography at enrollment and at the 2-year follow-up. The severity of posterior staphyloma and the presence of dome-shaped macula were also evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, 610 highly myopic eyes of 610 patients were analyzed. The prevalence of epiretinal membrane, myopic retinoschisis, and macular hole increased from 26.7%, 12.1%, and 4.4% at enrollment to 41.1%, 18.2%, and 9.5% at the 2-year follow-up, respectively. Epiretinal membrane progressed in 21.8% of eyes, but visual acuity did not decline significantly in these eyes. Myopic retinoschisis progressed in 6.8% of eyes, and macular hole progressed in 14.8% of eyes. Significantly greater best-corrected visual acuity reduction was detected in the eyes with myopic retinoschisis or macular hole progression than the rest ( P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that longer axial length, more-severe posterior staphyloma, and absence of dome-shaped macula were associated with myopic tractional maculopathy progression.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In highly myopic eyes, long-term visual acuity was relatively stable in those with epiretinal membrane, but was significantly affected by myopic retinoschisis or macular hole progression. Longer axial length, more-severe posterior staphyloma, and absence of dome-shaped macula were risk factors for myopic tractional maculopathy progression.\n"

      " International Validation of Myopic Traction Maculopathy Staging System.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the interobserver agreement of the myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) staging system (MSS).\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: Each observer was asked to look at the MSS Table and then identify, in each optical coherence tomography scan, one among four stages of MTM in the retina, one among three stages in the fovea, and, as secondary findings, the presence or absence of an outer lamellar macular hole and the presence or absence of epiretinal abnormalities. The interobserver agreement value was calculated using the Gwet's AC1 unweighted and AC2 weighted statistics. The outcomes were interpreted as poor (<0.00), slight (0.00 to 0.20), fair (0.21 to 0.40), moderate (0.41 to 0.60), substantial (0.61 to 0.80), or almost perfect (0.81 to 1.00) agreement.\n",
      "RESULTS: The agreement, among 65 participants, was 0.62 (AC1) and 0.77 (AC2) for the retina stage; 0.63 (AC1) and 0.81 (AC2) for the fovea stage; 0.56 (AC1) for the outer lamellar macular hole; and 0.26 (AC1) for epiretinal abnormalities.\n",

      " Idiopathic Choroidal Neovascularization in Pregnancy: A Case Report.\n",
      "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the abnormal growth of vessels from the choroidal vasculature to the neurosensory retina through the Bruch's membrane and is usually associated with \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Other causes include myopia, traumatic rupture of the choroid, multifocal choroiditis, and histoplasmosis. CNV is a major cause of visual loss and treatment is aimed at halting progression and stabilizing vision. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (IVT anti-VEGF) injection is the treatment of choice for CNV regardless of etiology. However, its use in pregnancy is debatable, due to its mechanism of action and lack of evidence of safety in pregnancy. Herein, we report a 27-year-old pregnant female, who complained of blurred and decreased vision in her left eye for two weeks. On examination, her unaided vision was 6/6 in her right eye and 6/18 partial in her left eye with no further improvement. Based on history, examination, and investigations she was diagnosed as a case of idiopathic CNV in pregnancy, being only the sixth reported case worldwide. Citing the risk of possible fetal adverse effects, the patient did not consent to the treatment despite extensive counseling. She was advised to follow up regularly and to receive IVT anti-VEGF injections immediately after delivery. A literature review was therefore undertaken to broaden our understanding of the treatment protocols and outcomes of using IVT anti-VEGF in pregnancy. This helped us to develop an understanding of the possible relative safety of such a treatment when individually tailored with a multi-disciplinary approach.\n",

      " [Photodynamic therapy in Germany-Quo vadis?].\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was originally approved for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and secondary choroidal neovascularization in myopia (mCNV). In addition, it is used as an off-label treatment in patients with choroidal hemangioma, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To track the development of PDT treatment numbers in Germany between 2006 and 2021 and to investigate the composition of the therapeutic indications.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective study the quality reports of German hospitals were evaluated in the period from 2006 to 2019 and the number of PDTs performed was recorded. In addition, the range of indications for PDT was determined exemplarily for the Eye Center at Medical Center, University of Freiburg and the Eye Center at St. Franziskus Hospital in Münster between 2006 and 2021. Finally, the estimated prevalence of CSC and an estimate of cases requiring treatment were used to calculate the number of patients in need of PDT treatment in Germany.\n",
      "RESULTS: The number of PDTs performed in Germany decreased from 1072 in 2006 to 202 in 2019. While PDT was used in 86% of cases in patients with nAMD and in 7% of cases with mCNV in 2006, it was mainly performed in patients with CSC (70%) and choroidal hemangiomas (21%) from 2016 to 2021. With an estimated incidence of CSC of 1:10,000 and assuming that 16% of patients develop chronic CCS requiring treatment, approximately 1330 PDTs would need to be performed per year in Germany for patients with newly diagnosed chronic CSC alone.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The decreasing numbers of PDT treatment performed in Germany is mainly due to a change to intravitreal injections as the preferred treatment for nAMD and mCNV. As PDT is currently the recommended treatment of choice for chronic CSC, an underprovision of PDT in Germany can be assumed. To enable an appropriate treatment for patients, a reliable verteporfin production, a simplified approval process by health insurance companies and a close cooperation between ophthalmologists in private practice and larger centers are urgently needed.\n"

      "METHODS: All participants underwent detailed ocular examinations. MM was subdivided into thin choroid, Bruch's membrane (BM) defects, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM) according to OCT-based classification system. Peripapillary atrophy area (PPA), tilt ratio, torsion, and mChT were individually measured.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 1947 participants were included. In multivariate logistics models, older age, longer axial length, larger PPA area, and thinner average mChT were more likely to have MM and different type of MM. Female participants were more likely to have MM and BM defects. A lower tilt ratio was more likely to be associated with CNV and MTM. The area under the curve (AUC) of single tilt ratio, PPA area, torsion, and topographic of mChT for MM, thin choroid, BM Defects, CNV, and MTM were 0.6581 to 0.9423, 0.6564 to 0.9335, 0.6120 to 0.9554, 0.5734 to 0.9312, 0.6415 to 0.9382, respectively.

      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 467 highly myopic eyes (axial length [AL] ≥26 mm) of 246 patients were included. Patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination, including multimodal imaging. Presence of PS was defined as the main variable analyzed between groups (PS vs non-PS): age, AL, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), atrophy/traction/neovascularization (ATN) components, and presence of severe pathologic myopia (PM). Two different cohorts were studied (age-matched and AL-matched) comparing PS vs non-PS eyes.\n",
      "RESULTS: In all, 325 eyes (69.59%) presented with PS. Eyes without PS were younger and had lower AL, ATN components, and prevalence of severe PM than those with PS (P < .001). Moreover, non-PS eyes had better BCVA (P < .001). Analyzing the age-matched cohort (P = .96); mean AL, A, and T components, and severe PM were significantly higher in the PS group (P < .001), as well as the N component (P < .005), showing worse BCVA (P < .001). Regarding the AL-matched cohort (P = .93), the PS group showed worse BCVA (P < .01), older age (P < .001), A (P < .001), and T components (P < .01), and severe PM (P < .01). The risk of PS increased by 10% per year of age (odds ratio = 1.109, P < .001) and by 132% per each millimeter of growth of AL (odds ratio = 2.318, P < .001).\n",

      " Bilaminar Graft of the Anterior Capsule and Internal Limiting Membrane: A Novel Surgical Technique for the Treatment of Macular Hole and Focal Macular Detachment Associated with High Myopia and Posterior Staphyloma.\n",
      "This case report describes a novel surgical technique for the treatment of macular hole and focal macular detachment associated with high myopia and posterior staphyloma. A 65-year-old female presented with a stage 3C myopic traction maculopathy and VA of 20/600. OCT examination confirmed a macular hole of 958 μm diameter, posterior staphyloma, and macular detachment. We performed combined phacoemulsification surgery with 23G pars plana vitrectomy; the anterior capsule was preserved and divided into two equal circular laminar flaps. We proceeded with central and peripheral vitrectomy, brilliant blue staining, and partial ILM peeling; capsular sheets were introduced sequentially in the vitreous chamber, the first one was implanted below the hole and attached to pigment epithelium, the second lamina was inserted into the hole, and the remaining portion of ILM was implanted crosswise below the edges of the hole. Macular-hole closure and progressive reapplication of the macular detachment were obtained, with a final VA of 20/80. Treatment of macular holes and focal macular detachment in high myopic eyes is complex, even for experienced surgeons. We propose a new technique with additional mechanisms based on anterior lens capsule and internal limiting membrane tissue properties that showed functional and anatomical improvement and could be considered an alternative treatment.\n",

      " Vitreous metabolomic signatures of pathological myopia with complications.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Pathological myopia (PM) is closely associated with blinding ocular morbidities. Identifying biomarkers can provide clues on pathogeneses. This study aimed to identify metabolic biomarkers and underlying mechanisms in the vitreous humour (VH) of PM patients with complications.\n",
      "METHODS: VH samples were collected from 39 PM patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) (n = 23) or macular hole (MH)/myopic retinoschisis (MRS) (n = 16) and 23 controls (MH with axial length < 26 mm) who underwent surgical treatment. VH metabolomic profiles were investigated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed to identify potential biomarkers for PM diagnosis.\n",
      "RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis identified nineteen and four metabolites altered in positive and negative modes, respectively, and these metabolites were involved in tryptophan metabolism. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that seventeen metabolites (AUC > 0.6) in the positive mode and uric acid in the negative mode represent potential biomarkers for PM with complications (AUC = 0.894). Pairwise and pathway analyses among the RRD-PM, MH/MRS-PM and control groups showed that tryptophan metabolism and uric acid were closely correlated with PM. Altered metabolites and pathways in our study were characterized by increased oxidative stress and altered energy metabolism. These results contribute to a better understanding of myopia progression with or without related complications.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides metabolomic signatures and related immunopathological features in the VH of PM patients, revealing new insight into the prevention and treatment of PM and related complications.\n"

      " Postoperative complications after successful primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the incidence and risk factors for cystoid macular edema (CME) and epiretinal membrane (ERM) development after surgery for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study involving 62 consecutive patients with primary RRD who underwent RRD repair with either scleral buckling (SB) or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). SB was used in young phakic patients without posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), high myopic patients, and RRD associated with either anterior or inferior retinal tears. PPV was preferred over SB in pseudophakic patients or those with media opacity and posterior breaks that precluded the SB approach. After surgery, the macular changes, including CME and ERM development, were evaluated 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were performed in phakic patients where media opacity or lens bulging did not allow the surgeon to perform surgical maneuvers. The inner limiting membrane (ILM) peeling was randomly performed in the macula-off and the macula-on RRD \"pending foveal detachment\" subgroup.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixty-two eyes affected by RRD who underwent SB or PPV were enrolled. CME occurred in 33.3% of the PPV group regardless of the ERM formation. No CME cases were found in the SB group. Macula-off RRD increased the risk of CME by odds ratio (OR) = 4.3 times compared to macula-on RRD regardless of the surgical procedure (p = 0.04). Macula-off status increased the risk of CME of OR = 1.73 times compared to macula-on in the PPV subgroup (p = 0.4). Combined cataract surgery and PPV increased the risk of CME by OR = 3.3 times (p = 0.16) compared to PPV alone, and ILM peeling increased the risk of postoperative CME by OR = 1.8 times (p = 0.37). ERM occurred in 28% of patients who did not undergo ILM peeling, and 29.42% of those who underwent ILM peeling developed ERM (p = 0.6).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The risk of postoperative CME was higher in patients with macula-off than in macula-on RRD and in those with macula-off RRD who underwent PPV. The SB would be advisable in patients with RRD sparing the macula. Furthermore, despite having several advantages, the combined phacoemulsification plus IOL implantation and PPV highly increased the risk of postoperative CME.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of anterior segment optical coherent tomography (AS OCT) in estimating the length of the pars plana and optimizing the sclerotomy entry site in vitrectomy for highly myopic eyes, facilitating membrane peeling.\n",
      "METHODS: Twenty-three eyes with myopic traction maculopathy were studied. The pars plana was examined using two methods: preoperative AS OCT and intraoperative measurement. The distance from the limbus to the ora serrata in two groups was measured to compare differences in length. The actual length of the entry site from the limbus and forceps used were noted in all eyes studied.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean axial length was 29.2 ± 2.3 mm for all 23 eyes. The average length between the limbus and ora serrata measured with AS OCT and intraoperative examination was 6,710 µ m (SD ± 459) and 6,671 µ m (SD ± 402), respectively, in the superotemporal region ( P > 0.05), and 6,340 µ m (SD ± 321) and 6,204 µ m (SD ± 402), respectively, in the superonasal region ( P >0.05). The mean length of the entry site from the limbus was 6.2 mm, and 28-mm forceps were used in 17 of 23 eyes (77%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The length of the pars plana varies depending on the axial length of the eye. Preoperative AS OCT enables accurate measurement of the pars plana in eyes with high myopia. AS OCT examination can help determine the optimal site for sclerotomy, allowing easier access to the macular region for membrane peeling in highly myopic eyes.\n"

      "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to blue light has seriously increased in our environment since the arrival of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and, in recent years, the proliferation of digital devices rich in blue light. This raises some questions about its potential deleterious effects on eye health. The aim of this narrative review is to provide an update on the ocular effects of blue light and to discuss the efficiency of methods of protection and prevention against potential blue light-induced ocular injury.\n",
      "METHODS: The search of relevant English articles was conducted in PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases until December 2022.\n",
      "RESULTS: Blue light exposure provokes photochemical reactions in most eye tissues, in particular the cornea, the lens, and the retina. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that certain exposures to blue light (depending on the wavelength or intensity) can cause temporary or permanent damage to some structures of the eye, especially the retina. However, currently, there is no evidence that screen use and LEDs in normal use are deleterious to the human retina. Regarding protection, there is currently no evidence of a beneficial effect of blue blocking lenses for the prevention of eye diseases, in particular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In humans, macular pigments (composed of lutein and zeaxanthin) represent a natural protection by filtering blue light, and can be increased through increased intake from foods or food supplements. These nutrients are associated with lower risk for AMD and cataract. Antioxidants such as vitamins C, E, or zinc might also contribute to the prevention of photochemical ocular damage by preventing oxidative stress.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Currently, there is no evidence that LEDs in normal use at domestic intensity levels or in screen devices are retinotoxic to the human eye. However, the potential toxicity of long-term cumulative exposure and the dose-response effect are currently unknown.\n",

      " Myopic macular Bruch's membrane defects.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To examine histologic characteristics of macular Bruchś membrane defects (BMD) in axially elongated eyes.\n",
      "DESIGN: Histomorphometric study.\n",
      "METHODS: Using light microscopy, we examined enucleated human globes for BMDs.\n",
      "RESULTS: In 247 eyes, BMDs were detected in 15 (6.1%) eyes (axial length:27.0-36.0 mm), in 10 of them in the macular region. Prevalence and size of BMDs (mean:1.93 ± 1.62 mm; range:0.22mm-6.24 mm) correlated with longer axial length (OR:1.52; 95%CI:1.19,1.94; P = 0.001) and higher prevalence of scleral staphylomas (OR:16.3; 95%CI:2.67,99.3; P < 0.001). The BMDs were smaller than corresponding gaps in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (1.93 ± 1.62 mm versus 2.61 mm ± 1.73 mm; P = 0.003), and larger than corresponding gaps in the inner nuclear layer (0.43 ± 0.76 mm; P = 0.008) and inner limiting membrane bridges (0.13 ± 0.33 mm; P = 0.001). Choriocapillaris thickness, BM thickness and RPE cell density did not vary (all P > 0.05) between the BDM border and adjacent areas. In the BMD, choriocapillaris and RPE were absent. The sclera was thinner in the BDM area than in adjacent areas (0.28 ± 0.19 mm versus 0.36 ± 0.13 mm; P = 0.006).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: BMDs as hallmarks of myopic macular degeneration are characterized by longer gaps in the RPE and smaller gaps in the outer nuclear layer and inner nuclear layer, by localized scleral thinning, and by a spatial association with scleral staphylomas. Thickness of the choriocapillaris and density of the RPE cell layer, both absent within the BDMs, do not vary between the BMD border and adjacent regions. The results suggest an association between BDMs and absolute scotomas, stretching of the adjacent retinal nerve fiver layer, and an axial elongation-associated stretching effect on BM as etiology of the BDMs.\n"

      " Economic evaluation of combined population-based screening for multiple blindness-causing eye diseases in China: a cost-effectiveness analysis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: More than 90% of vision impairment is avoidable. However, in China, a routine screening programme is currently unavailable in primary health care. With the dearth of economic evidence on screening programmes for multiple blindness-causing eye diseases, delivery options, and screening frequencies, we aimed to evaluate the costs and benefits of a population-based screening programme for multiple eye diseases in China.\n",
      "METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic Markov model for a cohort of individuals aged 50 years and older with a total of 30 1-year cycles. We calculated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of screening programmes for multiple major blindness-causing eye diseases in China, including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and pathological myopia, from a societal perspective (including direct and indirect costs). We analysed rural and urban settings separately by different screening delivery options (non-telemedicine [ie, face-to-face] screening, artificial intelligence [AI] telemedicine screening, and non-AI telemedicine screening) and frequencies. We calculated incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) using quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of the cost per blindness year avoided. One-way deterministic and simulated probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of the main outcomes.\n",
      "FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, non-telemedicine combined screening of multiple eye diseases satisfied the criterion for a highly cost-effective health intervention, with an ICUR of US$2494 (95% CI 1130 to 2716) and an ICER of $12 487 (8773 to 18 791) in rural settings. In urban areas, the ICUR was $624 (395 to 907), and the ICER was $7251 (4238 to 13 501). Non-AI telemedicine screening could result in fewer costs and greater gains in health benefits (ICUR $2326 [1064 to 2538] and ICER $11 766 [8200 to 18 000] in rural settings; ICUR $581 [368 to 864] and ICER $6920 [3926 to 13 231] in urban settings). AI telemedicine screening dominated no screening in rural settings, and in urban settings the ICUR was $244 (-315 to 1073) and the ICER was $2567 (-4111 to 15 389). Sensitivity analyses showed all results to be robust. By further comparison, annual AI telemedicine screening was the most cost-effective strategy in both rural and urban areas.\n",
      "INTERPRETATION: Combined screening of multiple eye diseases is cost-effective in both rural and urban China. AI coupled with teleophthalmology presents an opportunity to promote equity in eye health.\n",

      " Evaluation of retinal vascular density and related factors using OCTA in children and adolescents with myopia without maculopathy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopia is the most common ophthalmic condition worldwide with a rapidly increasing prevalence. This study aimed to compare the retinal microvasculature in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) in children and adolescents with mild and moderate/high myopia using optical coherence tomography angiography, determine the relationship between retinal parameters and axial length (AL), and understand the occurrence and progression of myopia in microcirculation.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective observational study included 39 participants with mild myopia and 33 participants with moderate/high myopia. Vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) in the SCP, the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), and AL were compared between the groups and the relationship between these retinal parameters and AL was assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: No difference in SCP VD or PD was observed between the two groups. The FAZ did not differ significantly between groups whereas significant differences in age, height, refractive status, and AL were observed. Significantly shorter AL was observed in participants with mild myopia compared with the moderate/high myopia group. Age was positively correlated with height (r = 0.852) and refractive status was negatively correlated with AL (r = -0.588). AL was positively correlated with VD (r = 0.317) and PD (r = 0.308) in the SCP and AL was negatively correlated with the FAZ (r = -0.434).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that superficial foveal microvessel density was unaffected in children and adolescents without pathological myopia. However, myopia progression was associated with a change in AL, and an AL increase altered macular blood flow.\n"

      "METHODS: A retrospective study of all consecutive cases of surgically operated MTM over 12 years (2009-2020) was conducted in a myopia prevalent region. We compared outcomes among three groups: (1) myopic macular hole (MH), (2) myopic macular hole with retinal detachment (MHRD), and (3) myopic foveoschisis with retinal detachment (MFRD).\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifty-one cases were included in the study (8 cases of MH, 33 cases of MHRD and 10 cases of MFRD). The overall mean age was 63.8 +/- 8.7 with a female preponderance (2:1). The mean age of the MH group (58.6) was significantly younger than the MHRD group (64.2) and MFRD group (66.6) (p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis using ATN classification did not show its correlation with both visual improvement and anatomical success.

      " Pathologic myopia in highly myopic patients with high axial anisomyopia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine prevalence of anisomyopia (axial length (AL) difference ≥2.5 mm) among high myopes ((HMs), defined by spherical equivalent of ≤6.0 diopters or AL ≥ 26.5 mm). To characterise the shorter anisomyopic eye (SAE) and evaluate if pathologic myopia (PM) in the longer anisomyopic eye (LAE) was associated with increased risk of PM in the SAE.\n",
      "METHODS: 1168 HMs were recruited from Singapore National Eye Centre clinic for this cross-sectional study. Biometry, fundus photography and swept-source optical coherence tomography were performed. Patients with high axial anisomyopia were identified. Structural characteristics and presence of PM were described. Stepwise multivariate regression explored associations between PM in the LAE and pathology in the SAE, controlling for confounding variables.\n",
      "RESULTS: Prevalence of anisomyopia was 15.8% (184 of 1168 patients). Anisomyopic patients (age 65.8±13.5 years) had mean AL of 30.6±2.0 mm and 26.2±2.3 mm in the LAE and SAE, respectively. 52.7% of SAEs had AL < 26.5 mm. Prevalence of myopic macular degeneration, macula-involving posterior staphyloma (PS), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) in the SAE was 52.2%, 36.5%, 13.0% and 8.2%, respectively. Macular hole in the LAE was associated with increased risk of MTM in the SAE (OR=4.88, p=0.01). mCNV in the LAE was associated with mCNV in the SAE (OR=3.57, p=0.02). PS in the LAE was associated with PS in the SAE (OR=4.03, p<0.001).\n",

      "METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library were searched for eligible publications before July 2021. Studies assessing the relationship between sleep duration and any one of the major eye disorders were identified. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using random-effects models.\n",
      "RESULTS: We identified 21 relevant articles including 777348 participants, and 17 were cross-sectional, 3 were longitudinal, and 1 was case-control. Pooled results indicated that long sleep duration was significantly associated with the risk of DR (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.24, 2.73), and short sleep duration was significantly associated with the risk of cataract (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.36). Besides, a significant relationship was observed between the risk of DR and long sleep duration per day (i.e., nighttime sleep plus daytime napping, OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.23, 2.44) rather than per night (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 0.95, 4.99). The extreme of long sleep duration (i.e., >10 h per night) increased the risk of myopia (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01, 1.04).\n",

      " A deep network using coarse clinical prior for myopic maculopathy grading.\n",
      "Pathological Myopia (PM) is a globally prevalent eye disease which is one of the main causes of blindness. In the long-term clinical observation, myopic maculopathy is a main criterion to diagnose PM severity. The grading of myopic maculopathy can provide a severity and progression prediction of PM to perform treatment and prevent myopia blindness in time. In this paper, we propose a feature fusion framework to utilize tessellated fundus and the brightest region in fundus images as prior knowledge. The proposed framework consists of prior knowledge extraction module and feature fusion module. Prior knowledge extraction module uses traditional image processing methods to extract the prior knowledge to indicate coarse lesion positions in fundus images. Furthermore, the prior, tessellated fundus and the brightest region in fundus images, are integrated into deep learning network as global and local constrains respectively by feature fusion module. In addition, rank loss is designed to increase the continuity of classification score. We collect a private color fundus dataset from Beijing TongRen Hospital containing 714 clinical images. The dataset contains all 5 grades of myopic maculopathy which are labeled by experienced ophthalmologists. Our framework achieves 0.8921 five-grade accuracy on our private dataset. Pathological Myopia (PALM) dataset is used for comparison with other related algorithms. Our framework is trained with 400 images and achieves an AUC of 0.9981 for two-class grading. The results show that our framework can achieve a good performance for myopic maculopathy grading.\n",

      " Comparison of Refractive Outcomes in Patients with Highly Myopic Versus Non-highly Myopic Eyes Undergoing Phacovitrectomy.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Combined phacovitrectomy is gaining popularity due to efficiency and immediate visual improvement. However, concerns regarding erroneous intraocular lens (IOL) calculation in combination surgery are increasing, such as myopic shift owing to a thick macula and consequent underestimation of the axial length. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the refractive outcomes of combined phacovitrectomy in patients with highly myopic and non-highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who received combined phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation, and small gauge pars plana vitrectomy for cataract and macular pathologies in highly myopic and non-highly myopic eyes. Pre- and postoperative evaluation and ocular parameters were recorded, and analyses were performed using the Student's t test and regression analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 133 patients with macular pathologies, including myopic tractional maculopathy, macular hole, and epiretinal membrane, were enrolled. SRK II or SRK/T models were used for calculating IOL. The mean absolute error of refraction change was 0.65 D; 83.5% of patients were within 1-D error, 57.9% within 0.5-D error, and 35.3% within 0.25-D error, with SRK/T showing better precision and yielding more myopic shift. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy of SRK II or SRK/T was better in patients with non-highly myopic eyes. Moreover, Barrett's universal II formula was not superior to SRK II or SRK/T in the prediction of postoperative refractive error (p = 0.48).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Refractive outcomes were satisfactory in the cohort of patients with highly myopic eyes. The combined implementation of SRK II and SRK/T was not inferior to Barrett's universal II formula in predicting satisfactory refractive outcomes. Combination surgery can be an option for patients with both cataract and macular pathologies.\n"

This study clarifies this problem and can guide clinicians to prevent vision changes of patients according to OCT performance.\n",
      "METHODS: 76 patients with MCN, included 25 AMD, 21 CEC, 18 PM and 12 ICN [refer to Chinese Ophthalmology (3rd Edition)], detected by OCT instrument, were enrolled in this study from June 2020 to June 2022. The OCT manifestations and indexes were observed. A comprehensive refractometer was used for detection of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and axial length (AL). Pearson chi squared and 1 way analysis of variance were used for enumeration data and continuous data test, and Pearson correlation coefficient was used for relationship analysis.\n",

      " Atrophic, Tractional, and Neovascular Grading System in a Dome-Shaped Macula and Ridge-Shaped Macula Highly Myopic Cohort.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to analyze the atrophic, tractional, and neovascular (ATN) components grading in highly myopic patients with dome-shaped macula (DSM) and ridge-shaped macula (RSM).\n",
      "METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, noninterventional study. 57 eyes of 38 different patients were included. They were classified as DSM or RSM based on the number of radial scans that showed an inward protrusion ≥50 µm in the swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) (12 = DSM; &lt;12 = RSM). All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination in addition to SS-OCT. They were graded using the ATN system for myopic maculopathy by 2 masked retina specialists that assessed the atrophic (A), tractional (T), and neovascular (N) components in order to analyze the differences between the groups. As complementary measurements, age, axial length, and best-corrected visual acuity were collected. Height and orientation of the macular bulge and the presence of Bruch's membrane defects, scleral perforating vessels, and staphyloma were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: Out of total 57 eyes, 13 eyes (22.8%) were classified as DSM. Regarding the atrophic component (A), there were statistically significant differences between groups, with DSM group showing a greater stage of atrophy (predominantly stage A3 in 69.2% of the sample) compared to the RSM group (predominantly stage A2 in 61.3% of the sample) (p &lt; 0.05). For the T and N components, there were no significant differences between groups. The presence of Bruch's membrane defects was more frequently seen in DSM (p &lt; 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: DSM group showed more Bruch's membrane defects and a greater stage of the atrophy component, based on the ATN grading system, compared with RSM group. As Bruch's membrane may have biomechanical properties in terms of strength, the defects found around the macula, added to the major atrophic component, may be a cause of a local relaxation that induce a central bulge forming the dome.\n",

      " Exosomal MicroRNA Profiling in Vitreous Humor Derived From Pathological Myopia Patients.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Pathologic myopia (PM) is one of the primary causes of blindness. This study aims to explore the possible relations between the composition of microRNA in vitreous exosomes of patients with PM and the progression of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: Vitreous humor (VH) samples were collected from patients undergoing retinal surgery. A total of 15 and 12 VH samples were obtained from patients with PM and control, respectively. The PM group was divided into PM-L (G2) and PM-H groups (G3 and G4) in order to explore differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) that account for the relatively poor prognosis in G3 and G4 myopic maculopathy. A Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to find the persistently altered key microRNAs in myopic maculopathy progression. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were used.\n",
      "RESULTS: High purity exosomes were extracted from the vitreous fluid of patients with PM and control. The top five downregulated DEMs of PM-H versus PM-L can reflect the tendency of deterioration of PM-H myopic maculopathy. MiR-143-3p and miR-145-5p, which were found in WGCNA, may participate in the development of myopic maculopathy. These microRNAs all relate to the insulin resistance pathway.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore the relations between the progression of myopic maculopathy and vitreous exosomal microRNAs. Vitreous exosomal miR-143-3p and miR-145-5p can be considered biomarkers for patients with PM, and the vitreous exosomal DEM associated with PM-H may represent alarming signals of myopic maculopathy deterioration.\n"

      " Impact of high myopia on inner retinal layer thickness in type 2 diabetes patients.\n",
      "To investigate the impact of the combination of type 2 diabetes (DM) and high myopia on inner retinal layer thickness of the macular area. The patients were divided into four groups: control (group 1), patients with DM without high myopia (group 2), patients with high myopia without DM (group 3), and patients with DM and high myopia (group 4). Ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness was compared among the groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with GCC thickness. A total of 194 eyes were enrolled: 59 in group 1, 52 in group 2, 49 in group 3, and 34 in group 4. The average parafovea GCC thicknesses were 113.9 ± 10.4, 112.4 ± 11.2, 112.2 ± 7.8, and 102.6 ± 15.1 μm (P < 0.001), and the average perifovea GCC thicknesses were 104.8 ± 13.2, 103.5 ± 10.8, 103.6 ± 8.8, and 93.9 ± 15.5 μm in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (P = 0.001). In multivariate analyses, age (β = - 0.20, P = 0.007), DM duration (β = - 0.34, P = 0.023), and axial length (β = - 1.64, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with parafoveal GCC thickness. The GCC was significantly thinner when high myopia and DM were combined, compared to either condition alone. Additionally, age, DM duration, and axial length were significant factors associated with GCC thickness. The combination of mechanical stretching and neurodegeneration would accelerate neural damage to the retina, resulting in greater inner retinal layer thinning.\n"

      " Myopic macular diseases: A review.\n",
      "Recent evidence has demonstrated that the global public health burden of myopia is rising rapidly. Highly myopic eyes are associated with increased frequency of eye disorders that can lead to irreversible visual impairment. With recent technological advancement in ophthalmic imaging modalities, various macular complications associated with pathologic myopia are being elucidated. The development and progression of myopic chorioretinal atrophy, myopic macular neovascularization, myopic traction maculopathy and dome-shaped macula are vision-threatening myopic macular diseases. In order to overcome the challenges in managing patients with pathologic myopia, it is important to have a complete understanding in the natural course of these myopic macular diseases. Standardising the classification criteria of pathologic myopia is essential for enhancing clinical surveillance. Personalised pharmaceutical therapy and surgical interventions will help to optimise the treatment outcomes in patients suffering from these myopic macular diseases.\n",

      " Myopia: Histology, clinical features, and potential implications for the etiology of axial elongation.\n",
      "Myopic axial elongation is associated with various non-pathological changes. These include a decrease in photoreceptor cell and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell density and retinal layer thickness, mainly in the retro-equatorial to equatorial regions; choroidal and scleral thinning pronounced at the posterior pole and least marked at the ora serrata; and a shift in Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) occurring in moderately myopic eyes and typically in the temporal/inferior direction. The BMO shift leads to an overhang of Bruch's membrane (BM) into the nasal intrapapillary compartment and BM absence in the temporal region (i.e., parapapillary gamma zone), optic disc ovalization due to shortening of the ophthalmoscopically visible horizontal disc diameter, fovea-optic disc distance elongation, reduction in angle kappa, and straightening/stretching of the papillomacular retinal blood vessels and retinal nerve fibers. Highly myopic eyes additionally show an enlargement of all layers of the optic nerve canal, elongation and thinning of the lamina cribrosa, peripapillary scleral flange (i.e., parapapillary delta zone) and peripapillary choroidal border tissue, and development of circular parapapillary beta, gamma, and delta zone. Pathological features of high myopia include development of macular linear RPE defects (lacquer cracks), which widen to round RPE defects (patchy atrophies) with central BM defects, macular neovascularization, myopic macular retinoschisis, and glaucomatous/glaucoma-like and non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy. BM thickness is unrelated to axial length. Including the change in eye shape from a sphere in emmetropia to a prolate (rotational) ellipsoid in myopia, the features may be explained by a primary BM enlargement in the retro-equatorial/equatorial region leading to axial elongation.\n"

      " Roles of growth factors in eye development and ophthalmic diseases.\n",
      "Growth factors are active substances secreted by a variety of cells, which act as messengers to regulate cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Many growth factors are involved in the eye development or the pathophysiological processes of eye diseases. Growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor mediate the occurrence and development of diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization, cataract, diabetic macular edema, and other retinal diseases. On the other hand, growth factors like nerve growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, pigment epithelial-derived factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are known to promote optic nerve injury repair. Growth factors are also related to the pathogenesis of myopia. Fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, and insulin-like growth factor regulate scleral thickness and influence the occurrence and development of myopia. This article reviews growth factors involved in ocular development and ocular pathophysiology, discusses the relationship between growth factors and ocular diseases, to provide reference for the application of growth factors in ophthalmology.\n",

      " [Occurrence of myopic maculopathy in eyes with staphylomas of various localization].\n",
      "UNLABELLED: Complicated myopia develops in young people of working age, of which about 30% subsequently become visually impaired. Formation of ocular staphyloma affects the macula causing myopic maculopathy, which leads to significant and irreversible decrease in visual functions.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To study the occurrence frequency of various forms of myopic maculopathy in scleral staphylomas of different localization in patients with pathologic myopia.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 105 patients with high myopia (105 eyes, axial length ≥26 mm). The main group consisted of 50 patients with myopic scleral staphylomas (50 eyes). The comparison group - 55 patients (55 eyes) without scleral staphylomas.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the main group, myopic maculopathy was detected in 82% of eyes, it was absent in 96% of eyes in the comparison group. In the main group there were: staphyloma of the posterior pole of the eye with involvement of the optic nerve head (ONH) - 44% of eyes; macular staphyloma - 28% of eyes; peripapillary staphyloma - 12% of eyes; staphyloma below the ONH - 16% of eyes. Atrophic, neovascular and traction maculopathy was revealed in 22 eyes with staphylomas of the posterior pole of the eye. Dome-shaped changes in the macula were revealed in 17 patients (19 eyes) of the main group (15 eyes with staphylomas of the posterior pole of the eye, 4 eyes with macular staphylomas). The highest average value of axial length (30.94±0.81 mm) was noted in eyes with macular staphylomas, and the lowest (28.58±1.62 mm) - with staphylomas near the ONH.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The presence of myopic maculopathy is associated with the presence of staphylomas with the odds ratio of 120.7 (95%, confidence interval 24.7-589.3). Staphyloma of the posterior pole of the eye and macular staphyloma were associated with the most severe forms of myopic maculopathy and low visual acuity.\n"

      "INTRODUCTION: To design and evaluate a deep learning model based on ultra-widefield images (UWFIs) that can detect several common fundus diseases.\n",
      "METHODS: Based on 4574 UWFIs, a deep learning model was trained and validated that can identify normal fundus and eight common fundus diseases, namely referable diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, pathologic myopia, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, vitreous opacity, and optic neuropathy. The model was tested on three test sets with data volumes of 465, 979, and 525. The performance of the three deep learning networks, EfficientNet-B7, DenseNet, and ResNet-101, was evaluated on the internal test set. Additionally, we compared the performance of the deep learning model with that of doctors in a tertiary referral hospital.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared to the other two deep learning models, EfficientNet-B7 achieved the best performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the EfficientNet-B7 model on the internal test set, external test set A and external test set B were 0.9708 (0.8772, 0.9849) to 1.0000 (1.0000, 1.0000), 0.9683 (0.8829, 0.9770) to 1.0000 (0.9975, 1.0000), and 0.8919 (0.7150, 0.9055) to 0.9977 (0.9165, 1.0000), respectively. On a data set of 100 images, the total accuracy of the deep learning model was 93.00%, the average accuracy of three ophthalmologists who had been working for 2 years and three ophthalmologists who had been working in fundus imaging for more than 5 years was 88.00% and 94.00%, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: High performance was achieved on all three test sets using our UWFI multidisease classification model with a small sample size and fast model inference. The performance of the artificial intelligence model was comparable to that of a physician with 2-5 years of experience in fundus diseases at a tertiary referral hospital. The model is expected to be used as an effective aid for fundus disease screening.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: To investigate the feasibility and safety of scleral ultraviolet A (UVA) cross-linking (scleral CXL) on pathologically blindness.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a prospective, observational clinical study. Five patients with monocular blindness due to pathological myopic maculopathy were enrolled. Eyes with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) under 0.05 were defined as experimental eyes. The fellow eyes were defined as control eyes. Patients first underwent posterior scleral reinforcement (PSR) surgery in the control eye. Thereafter, scleral CXL surgery was performed in the experimental eye on the same day. Visual acuity, BCVA, slit lamp biomicroscopic examination, intraocular pressure measurement, corneal specula microscopies, axis length measurement, funduscopy with pupil dilation, color fundus photography, full-field flash electroretinography, optical coherence tomography, and color Doppler flow imaging were performed at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery.\n",
      "RESULTS: No signs of inflammation were observed after operation and throughout the follow-up period. Retinoschisis was improved, while choroidal neovascularization fibrosis and retinal and choroidal atrophy were unchanged after scleral CXL. There were no statistically significant differences in the ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery, and posterior ciliary artery parameters of color Doppler flow imaging or in retinal thickness, within experimental and control eyes, at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, or 12 months (P > 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study verified the feasibility and safety of scleral CXL on human blindness. The UVA-CXL on the sclera of human eyes seems to have the same effect as PSR in preventing progressive pathological myopia in the future.\n",

      "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\n",
      "METHODS: We used the DeSC database, a large-scale claims database for Japan, for entries between April 2014 and March 2021. We counted the number of anti-VEGF drug injections (aflibercept, ranibizumab, brolucizumab, and pegaptanib) administered every year, calculated the sex- and age-adjusted injection rates, and stratified these rates according to sex, age categories, anti-VEGF drugs, and diagnoses. We also calculated the number of injections administered within one year after the first injection according to the diagnoses.\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, 164,451 cases of anti-VEGF injections were identified. The sex- and age-adjusted rates of anti-VEGF injections per 1000 person-years increased from 7.9 in 2014 to 16.1 in 2020. Men were approximately twice as likely to receive anti-VEGF injections than women. The 70-79, 80-89, and ≥90 age categories had the highest rates, accounting for approximately 80%. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration had the highest rate, accounting for 60-70% over the study period. Aflibercept was the most commonly used drug, accounting for approximately 80% over the study period. The average number of injections within one year after the first injection was 4.4 for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, 2.7 for branch retinal vein occlusion, 3.1 for central retinal vein occlusion, and 3.5 for diabetic macular edema in 2020.\n",

To simply and quickly classify pathologic myopia (PM), a deep learning algorithm was developed and assessed to screen myopic maculopathy lesions based on color fundus photographs.\n",
      "METHODS: This study included 10,347 ocular fundus photographs from 7606 participants. Of these photographs, 8210 were used for training and validation, and 2137 for external testing. A deep learning algorithm was trained, validated, and externally tested to screen myopic maculopathy which was classified into four categories: normal or mild tessellated fundus, severe tessellated fundus, early-stage PM, and advanced-stage PM. The area under the precision-recall curve, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa were calculated and compared with those of retina specialists.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the validation data set, the model detected normal or mild tessellated fundus, severe tessellated fundus, early-stage PM, and advanced-stage PM with AUCs of 0.98, 0.95, 0.99, and 1.00, respectively; while in the external-testing data set of 2137 photographs, the model had AUCs of 0.99, 0.96, 0.98, and 1.00, respectively.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and causes of papillary and peripapillary hemorrhages (PPHs) in eyes with pathologic myopia (PM).\n",
      "METHODS: PM patients were retrospectively studied between 2011 and 2018. Fundus images were used to diagnose and classify the PPHs. Fundus fluorescein angiographic (FFA) and optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images were used to determine the status of the retinal vessels and tissue at and around the PPH sites. Visual field data determined by Goldmann perimetry and Humphrey visual field analyzer were also analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 2171 PM patients (3774 eyes) were examined. Eighty-eight patients (97 eyes) had PPHs (mean age 66.8 ± 11.9 years; mean axial length 30.79 ± 2.17 mm) for a prevalence of 4.05%. Thirty (30.9%) eyes recurred. Among the 90 eyes with a single-site PPH, the most common type and location were the conus type (49 eyes, 54.4%) and the temporal side (66 eyes, 73.3%), respectively. Regression analysis showed that patchy atrophy reduced the risk of recurrences than diffuse atrophy (P < 0.05), whereas a longer axial length and potential glaucoma increased the risk (both P < 0.05). FFA and OCT showed that PPHs developed in the area of straightened retinal arterioles (24 eyes), at or beside the peak of a ridge (10 eyes), in an area of compressed retinal tissue (two eyes).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: PPHs are present in 4.05% of PM eyes, and they are most often located in the temporal peripapillary atrophic region of the retina. Axial elongation, mild myopic maculopathy, and potential glaucoma are risk factors for recurrences.\n"

Large intraretinal cavities were noted on optical coherence tomography at the first postoperative exam in three patients and 12 to 18 months postoperation in the other two. The median height of the postoperative intraretinal cavities was 704 μm (range, 445-1287 μm). Inner retinal breaks were identified in all eyes, of which four were located in the paravascular area. The intraretinal cavity and schisis remained stable during the initial follow-up for an average of 35 months; later on, at > 5 years after the initial presentation two patients developed retinal detachment and one patient underwent vitrectomy with the retina reattached postoperatively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Large intraretinal cavities and schisis can be observed after MTM surgery, associated with paravascular inner breaks. The condition can progress after a long stable period; therefore, continuous follow-up is necessary.\n",

      " [Progression of Myopia - which Preventive Measures Can be Recommended?].\n",
      "The prevalence of myopia shows a worldwide increase with large regional differences. Especially high myopia enhances the risk of irreversible vision loss due to myopic maculopathy or other secondary effects. Reducing the prevalence and progression of myopia in schoolchildren is therefore a main goal in ophthalmology. Spending at least two hours a day outdoors is the easiest way to reduce myopia progression. Another modifiable factor is to reduce continuous near work with distances of less than 30 cm. Low-dose atropine eye drops administered once daily over two or more years have been shown to reduce myopia progression. Optical interventions which have been effective are multifocal contact lenses or orthokeratology contact lenses, but these have the risk of microbial keratitis. Whereas neither under- nor overcorrection of myopia have been proven effective, new so-called multisegment glasses have reduced myopia progression. Most of the studies concerning atropine and optic interventions have been performed in groups of Asian children, which are known to have more severe myopia progression, although actually there are many studies being conducted on Caucasian children. Still, there is also a lack of studies contrasting pharmacologic against optic interventions and comparing these with a combination of methods. The decision to start optic or pharmacologic measures can therefore only be an individual decision and is mainly based on age, refraction and progression in the past, while environmental factors should be assessed first.\n"

      " Toward Universal Eye Health Coverage-Key Outcomes of the World Health Organization Package of Eye Care Interventions: A Systematic Review.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Despite persistent inequalities in access to eye care services globally, guidance on a set of recommended, evidence-based eye care interventions to support country health care planning has not been available. To overcome this barrier, the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI) has been developed.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To describe the key outcomes of the PECI development.\n",
      "EVIDENCE REVIEW: A standardized stepwise approach that included the following stages: (1) selection of priority eye conditions by an expert panel after reviewing epidemiological evidence and health facility data; (2) identification of interventions and related evidence for the selected eye conditions from a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); stage 2 included a systematic literature search, screening of title and abstracts (excluding articles that were not relevant CPGs), full-text review to assess disclosure of conflicts of interest and affiliations, quality appraisal, and data extraction; (3) expert review of the evidence extracted in stage 2, identification of missed interventions, and agreement on the inclusion of essential interventions suitable for implementation in low- and middle-income resource settings; and (4) peer review.\n",
      "FINDINGS: Fifteen priority eye conditions were chosen. The literature search identified 3601 articles. Of these, 469 passed title and abstract screening, 151 passed full-text screening, 98 passed quality appraisal, and 87 were selected for data extraction. Little evidence (≤1 CPG identified) was available for pterygium, keratoconus, congenital eyelid disorders, vision rehabilitation, myopic macular degeneration, ptosis, entropion, and ectropion. In stage 3, domain-specific expert groups voted to include 135 interventions (57%) of a potential 235 interventions collated from stage 2. After synthesis across all interventions and eye conditions, 64 interventions (13 health promotion and education, 6 screening and prevention, 38 treatment, and 7 rehabilitation) were included in the PECI.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review of CPGs for priority eye conditions, followed by an expert consensus procedure, identified 64 essential, evidence-based, eye care interventions that are required to achieve universal eye health coverage. The review identified some important gaps, including a paucity of high-quality, English-language CPGs, for several eye diseases and a dearth of evidence-based recommendations on eye health promotion and prevention within existing CPGs.\n",

      " Impact of prior pars plana vitrectomy on development of cystoid macular edema after uneventful cataract surgery.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate whether a history of prior pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) predisposes to the development of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (CME).\n",
      "SETTING: New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\n",
      "METHODS: Records of 365 subjects who underwent PPV for RRD and subsequent cataract surgery between 2017 and 2020 were reviewed. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory retinal vascular disease, uveitis, advanced age-related macular degeneration, intraocular infection, myopic maculopathy, or significant intraoperative complications precluding posterior chamber intraocular lens placement were excluded. Age-matched subjects who underwent routine cataract surgery served as controls. Clinical data and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings up to 4 years postoperatively were obtained.\n",
      "RESULTS: 54 eyes underwent uneventful cataract surgery by phacoemulsification and had a history of PPV with gas tamponade. 55 eyes underwent uneventful cataract surgery only. The average follow-up time after cataract surgery was 39.1 months. In eyes with a history of PPV, the incidence of OCT-detected CME was 27.8% (15/54) compared with 3.8% (2/55) in the control group ( P < .001) and the incidence of clinically significant CME was 18.5% (10/54) compared with 1.8% (1/55) in the control group ( P = .004). 80% (12/15) of CME cases were treated with topical therapy, and none required intravitreal injection.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Prior PPV for RRD is associated with an increased incidence of pseudophakic CME after uneventful cataract surgery. Prophylactic or prolonged postoperative anti-inflammatory topical therapy may be prudent to consider in these patients.\n"

      " Single-cell multiome of the human retina and deep learning nominate causal variants in complex eye diseases.\n",
      "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of eye disorders have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with ocular disease. However, the vast majority of these variants are noncoding, making it challenging to interpret their function. Here we present a joint single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility of the adult human retina with more than 50,000 cells, which we used to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated by GWASs of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, myopia, and type 2 macular telangiectasia. We integrate this atlas with a HiChIP enhancer connectome, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data, and base-resolution deep learning models to predict noncoding SNPs with causal roles in eye disease, assess SNP impact on transcription factor binding, and define their known and novel target genes. Our efforts nominate pathogenic SNP-target gene interactions for multiple vision disorders and provide a potentially powerful resource for interpreting noncoding variation in the eye.\n",

      " SHP-1 knockdown suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis and aggravates mitochondria-dependent apoptosis induced by all trans retinal through the STING/AMPK pathways.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress-caused damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) underlies the onset and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Impaired mitochondrial biogenesis sensitizes RPE cells to mitochondrial dysfunction, energy insufficiency and death. Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP)-1 is important in regulating immune responses and cell survival. However, its roles in cell survival are not always consistent. Until now, the effects of SHP-1 on RPE dysfunction, especially mitochondrial homeostasis, remain to be elucidated. We sought to clarify the effects of SHP-1 in RPE cells in response to atRAL-induced oxidative stress and determine the regulatory mechanisms involved.\n",
      "METHODS: In the all trans retinal (atRAL)-induced oxidative stress model, we used the vector of lentivirus to knockdown the expression of SHP-1 in ARPE-19 cells. CCK-8 assay, Annexin V/PI staining and JC-1 staining were utilized to determine the cell viability, cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential. We also used immunoprecipitation to examine the ubiquitination modification of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its interaction with SHP-1. The expression levels of mitochondrial marker, proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis, and signaling molecules involved were examined by western blotting analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: We found that SHP-1 knockdown predisposed RPE cells to apoptosis, aggravated mitochondrial damage, and repressed mitochondrial biogenesis after treatment with atRAL. Immunofluoresent staining and immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that SHP-1 interacted with the endoplasmic reticulum-resident STING and suppressed K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of STING. Inhibition of STING with the specific antagonist H151 attenuated the effects of SHP-1 knockdown on mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative damage. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway acted as the crucial downstream target of STING and was involved in the regulatory processes.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SHP-1 knockdown potentiates STING overactivation and represses mitochondrial biogenesis and cell survival, at least in part by blocking the AMPK pathway in RPE cells. Therefore, restoring mitochondrial health by regulating SHP-1 in RPE cells may be a potential therapeutic strategy for degenerative retinal diseases including AMD.\n"

      " Hospital-Based Study of Risk Factors Associated with Development of Myopic Macular Neovascularization in Highly Myopic Eyes.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Myopic macular neovascularization (MNV) is the most common cause of a reduction of central vision in eyes with pathologic myopia, and it can progress to macular atrophy in the long term. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with the development of MNVs.\n",
      "METHODS: There were 17,198 follow-up records from 5,409 eyes of 2,784 highly myopic patients that were reviewed. The general information and ophthalmic information in the records were studied. The significance of the correlations of factors associated with the development and predicting the development of myopic MNV were determined.\n",
      "RESULTS: Being a woman (odds ratio [OR] = 0.727, p < 0.001), having a longer axial length (OR = 0.948, p < 0.001), having a poorer baseline best-correct visual acuity (BCVA, OR = 2.098, p < 0.001), having severe myopic maculopathy (overall: p < 0.001), prior myopic MNV in the fellow eye (OR = 4.105, p < 0.001), presence of patchy atrophy (overall p < 0.001), lacquer cracks (OR = 1.718, p < 0.001), prior foveal retinal detachment (RD, OR = 3.269, p < 0.001), prior macular hole (MH, OR = 0.641, p < 0.001), prior macular retinoschisis (OR = 1.533, p < 0.001), and prior macular edema (OR = 1.508, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with the development of myopic MNV. Eyes with MNV and patchy atrophy would require an intensive follow-up examination for myopic patients as the fellow eye would have a risk of >70% for the development of myopic MNV in 3 years and nearly 80% in 5 years.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to pay special attention to eyes with severe grades of myopic maculopathy, prior myopic MNV in the fellow eye, presence of patchy atrophy, and prior foveal retinal detachment to determine the onset of myopic MNV.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the association of retinal sensitivity with microstructural features in optical coherence tomography (OCT) of high myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 78 eyes (78 patients). Microstructural features on spectral-domain OCT, such as the integrity of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), ellipsoid zone (EZ), and external limiting membrane (ELM) and outer retinoschisis, were evaluated at each retinal location corresponding to microperimetric testing points.\n",
      "RESULTS: For all testing points, retinal sensitivity was significantly associated with the integrity of the RPE, EZ, and ELM (all P < 0.001) based on OCT but not with outer retinoschisis (P = 0.183). A higher category of myopic maculopathy according to the Meta-Analysis of Pathologic Myopia classification was associated with lower mean retinal sensitivity (P < 0.001). In eyes with patchy atrophy (PA), mean retinal sensitivity of testing points adjacent to the PA lesion (15.7 ± 6.8 dB) was greater than points within or at the PA border (2.6 ± 5.2 dB; P < 0.001) but lower than distant points (19.6 ± 4.3 dB; P < 0.001). Microstructural features in OCT were well correlated with the differences in retinal sensitivity according to myopic maculopathy severity and proximity to the PA lesion.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In highly myopic eyes, retinal sensitivity on microperimetry was strongly associated with microstructural features in OCT. Both retinal sensitivity and microstructure were affected by the severity of myopic degeneration and proximity to the PA lesion.\n"

      "DESIGN: This was a retrospective, longitudinal population study using health care consumption data from the Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS; the French National Health Information Database), which covers approximately 99% of the French population.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: We identified individuals treated for nAMD from the French population 50 years of age and older. Identification criteria were nAMD diagnosis or reimbursement of nAMD treatments (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injection or dynamic phototherapy with verteporfin). Exclusion criteria were high myopia, diagnosis of other retinal diseases, and other treatments for macular diseases (dexamethasone implant, laser therapy, etc.).\n",
      "METHODS: We calculated incidence and prevalence based on the age-matched general population in France. Adjustment for age and sex was also performed for incidence.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and prevalence of nAMD in the French population between 2008 and 2018.\n",
      "RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2018, we identified 342 961 patients with nAMD (67.5% women). Mean ± standard deviation age at nAMD diagnosis or first treatment increased from 78.8 ± 8.1 years in 2008 to 81.2 ± 7.9 years in 2018. In 2018, annual incidence was 0.149% and prevalence was 1.062% for the French population 50 years of age or older. Incidence was stable over the 10-year period. Annual incidence increased with age (0.223%, 0.380%, and 0.603% in those 60 years of age or older, 70 years of age or older, and 80 years of age or older, respectively), with similar trends for prevalence. No major differences were observed among the 14 regions of France for incidence or prevalence. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration incidence in 2018 was not impacted by the availability of primary or ophthalmology care in patients' localities.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: This study compared the surgical outcomes in eyes with myopic foveoschisis (MF) according to the recently developed ATN classification system.\n",
      "METHODS: This was an observational case series of 64 consecutive eyes that underwent vitrectomy for MF. Eyes were classified into severe myopic maculopathy (MM) (n = 43) and non-severe MM (n = 21) groups according to the ATN classification system. The primary outcome measures constituted best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and anatomical changes.\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, BCVA improved from 0.97 to 0.53 (P < 0.001) after surgery. The ATN score was significantly lower in the eyes with vision improvement than those without vision improvement (P < 0.001). In the subgroup, BCVA improved from 0.79 to 0.28 in the non-severe MM group (P < 0.001), and improved from 1.05 to 0.65 in the severe MM group (P = 0.001) after surgery. The non-severe MM group achieved better postoperative BCVA (P = 0.001) and were more likely to gain vision improvement (P < 0.001) after surgery compared with the severe MM group. Anatomical success was achieved in 62 of the 64 eyes (96.88%). Two eyes with anatomical failure developed full-thickness macular holes postoperatively; both were in the severe MM group.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: For patients with MF, different severity of MM based on ATN classification could lead to a significantly different prognosis after surgery. For patients with high ATN scores, the operative decision should be made cautiously for the worse anatomical and visual prognosis. ATN system is instructive in making operative proposals for MF.\n"

      " The safety and tolerability of levodopa eye drops for the treatment of ocular disorders: A randomized first-in-human study.\n",
      "Myopia is the leading cause of low vision worldwide and can lead to significant pathological complications. Therefore, to improve patient outcomes, the field continues to develop novel interventions for this visual disorder. Accordingly, this first-in-human study reports on the safety profile of a novel dopamine-based ophthalmic treatment for myopia, levodopa/carbidopa eye drops. This phase I, first-in-human, monocenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, paired-eye, multidose, randomized clinical trial was undertaken in healthy adult males aged 18-30 years (mean age 24.9 ± 2.7) at the University of Canberra Eye Clinic, Australia. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a low (1.4 levodopa:0.34 carbidopa [μmoles/day], n = 14) or standard dose (2.7 levodopa:0.68 carbidopa [μmoles/day], n = 15) of levodopa/carbidopa eye drops in one eye and placebo in the fellow eye once daily for 4 weeks (28 days). Over this 4-week trial, and after a 4-month follow-up visit, levodopa/carbidopa treatment had no significant effect on ocular tolerability and anterior surface integrity, visual function, ocular health, refraction/ocular biometry, and did not induce any non-ocular adverse events. These results indicate that topical levodopa/carbidopa is safe and tolerable to the eye, paving the way for future studies on the efficacy of this novel ophthalmic formulation in the treatment of human myopia. The findings of this study have implications not only for the treatment of myopia, but in a number of other visual disorders (i.e., amblyopia, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) in which levodopa has been identified as a potential clinical intervention.\n"

      " Development of a deep learning algorithm for myopic maculopathy classification based on OCT images using transfer learning.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To apply deep learning (DL) techniques to develop an automatic intelligent classification system identifying the specific types of myopic maculopathy (MM) based on macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using transfer learning (TL).\n",
      "METHOD: In this retrospective study, a total of 3,945 macular OCT images from 2,866 myopic patients were recruited from the ophthalmic outpatients of three hospitals. After culling out 545 images with poor quality, a dataset containing 3,400 macular OCT images was manually classified according to the ATN system, containing four types of MM with high OCT diagnostic values. Two DL classification algorithms were trained to identify the targeted lesion categories: Algorithm A was trained from scratch, and algorithm B using the TL approach initiated from the classification algorithm developed in our previous study. After comparing the training process, the algorithm with better performance was tested and validated. The performance of the classification algorithm in the test and validation sets was evaluated using metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, quadratic-weighted kappa score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Moreover, the human-machine comparison was conducted. To better evaluate the algorithm and clarify the optimization direction, the dimensionality reduction analysis and heat map analysis were also used to visually analyze the algorithm.\n",
      "RESULTS: Algorithm B showed better performance in the training process. In the test set, the algorithm B achieved relatively robust performance with macro AUC, accuracy, and quadratic-weighted kappa of 0.986, 96.04% (95% CI: 0.951, 0.969), and 0.940 (95% CI: 0.909-0.971), respectively. In the external validation set, the performance of algorithm B was slightly inferior to that in the test set. In human-machine comparison test, the algorithm indicators were inferior to the retinal specialists but were the same as the ordinary ophthalmologists. In addition, dimensionality reduction visualization and heatmap visualization analysis showed excellent performance of the algorithm.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our macular OCT image classification algorithm developed using the TL approach exhibited excellent performance. The automatic diagnosis system for macular OCT images of MM based on DL showed potential application prospects.\n"

      " Hypotony Maculopathy Related to Anti-VEGF Intravitreal Injection.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To describe a case of hypotony maculopathy following anti-VEGF intravitreal injection (IVI) in a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PE).\n",
      "METHODS: Clinical case report.\n",
      "RESULTS: A 52-year-old male complained of right eye (OD) vision loss 2 days after an uncomplicated anti-VEGF IVI for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to angioid streaks. Relevant medical history included PE, pathologic myopia, and a previous pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) due to a retinal detachment. OD best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) dropped from 6/12 to 6/18 after the IVI. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 3 mmHg and chorioretinal folds were evident in the posterior pole. Topical dexamethasone and atropine were prescribed, and full recovery was noticed after 3 days. Four months later, the patient developed a new episode of vision loss after another IVI. His BCVA was counting fingers, IOP was 2mmHg, and more noticeable chorioretinal folds were found. This time, an open scleral wound at the injection site was evident and a scleral suture was necessary. Once again, the patient recovered well.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Hypotony maculopathy following intravitreal injection is a rare condition. However, the described patient presented several conditions which could be related with poor scleral wound closure: intrinsic scleral fragility due to myopia and pseudoxanthoma elasticum; repeated IVI procedures; and absence of vitreous in the posterior segment due to prior vitrectomy. Despite the good outcome, hypotony maculopathy may be a sight-threatening condition, and special attention is necessary for specific patients with risk factors.\n"

      " Myopic Foveoschisis\n",
      "None: Myopic foveoschisis, also known as myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) or myopic macular schisis, is a relatively rare entity that affects eyes with pathological myopia (-6.00 diopters or more of myopia). These eyes often have a posterior staphyloma, which has been implicated as an etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of MTM. Patients of myopic foveoschisis usually present with a gradual, often progressive, painless diminution of vision in either or both eyes, which may be affected simultaneously or sequentially. Foveoschisis was first described by Takano and Kishi in 1999, as a split in the layers of retina at the fovea, in eyes with posterior staphyloma. In the past, the diagnosis of MTM was difficult because of high myopic eyes offering a poor contrast when being examined by an ophthalmoscope. With the addition of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), the early recognition and prompt treatment of myopic foveoschisis have been made possible.\n",

      "None: Myopia, colloquially referred to as shortsightedness or nearsightedness, is one of the most common global eye diseases. It occurs when the optical power of the eye is too high for the corresponding axial length of the eye, resulting in images of distant objects being focused in front of the retina. Myopia can be corrected by wearing glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. However, pathologic myopia (PM) refers to a subset of ocular conditions associated with high myopia. The exact diagnostic criteria of PM have not been established. Some have defined PM based on an absolute cutoff value of refractive power (-6 to -8D) or axial length (26.5mm), while others have based it on the presence of myopic maculopathy.\n"

      "OBSERVATIONS: A 17-year-old male with pathologic myopia and history of retinopathy of prematurity previously treated with laser ablation in both eyes presented with reduced visual acuity in his right eye from choroidal detachment and hypotony maculopathy. In the absence of uveitis and intraocular pressure lowering medications, it was determined that repeated nocturnal ocular compression from circumaural headphones created episodes of hypotony. With avoidance of this behavior and in the absence of pathologic aqueous dynamics, intraocular pressure normalized with gradual resolution of choroidal thickening and restoration to baseline visual acuity.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Persistent and prolonged ocular compression, even unintentionally, can create hypotony with risk for vision loss, maculopathy, and choroidal detachment.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser ablation of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) to treat myopic macular retinoschisis.\n",
      "METHODS: Four patients with myopic myopic macular retinoschisis that extended out of the macular area were studied. All patients underwent yttrium aluminum garnet laser ablation of the detached ILM in the paramacular area, and the eyes were examined by ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography at the baseline and 6 months after the treatment. The measured outcomes were the foveal retinal thickness and the best-corrected visual acuity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser was applied to the paramacular ILM in all four eyes. In each eye, the procedure failed to disrupt the ILM, and no significant changes were observed in foveal retinal thickness or best-corrected visual acuity subsequently. No serious adverse event occurred in all eyes. A transient intraretinal hemorrhage developed at the site of the application in two eyes but resolved within a week after the treatment.\n",

Each participant underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, and posterior scleral height (PSH) was measured in swept-source optical coherence tomography images. PSH, vitreoretinal interface abnormities and myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM) were compared among groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinoschisis was found in 195 (43.5%) eyes, among which 170 (37.9%) had PVRS, 123 (27.5%) had PPRS, and 103 (23.0%) had MRS. MRS was found to be combined with PVRS in 96 of 103 (93.2%) eyes. MAM was one of the risk factors for RS (odds ratio [OR], 2.459; p = 0.005). Higher nasal PSH was the only risk factor for PVRS (OR, 9.103; p = 0.008 per 1-mm increase). Elongation of axial length (AL) (OR, 1.891; p < 0.001 per 1-mm increase), higher PSH in nasal (OR, 5.059; p = 0.009 per 1-mm increase) and temporal (OR, 13.021; p = 0.012 per 1-mm increase), epiretinal membrane (ERM; OR, 2.841; p = 0.008) and vitreomacular traction (VMT; OR, 7.335; p = 0.002) were risk factors for MRS.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Paravascular retinoschisis is the most common type of RS in HM and MRS is mostly combined with PVRS. MAM is one of the risk factors for RS. In addition to longer AL and higher PSH, the presence of VMT and ERM also play an important role in the formation of MRS.\n"

      "RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age and gender between HM patients and controls. Three types of changes of large choroidal veins were found in 103 HM eyes (58.86%): Asymmetry of vortex veins in 44 eyes (25.14%), isolated long vein across the macula in 58 eyes (33.14%), and intervortex anastomoses in 25 eyes (14.29%). Similar changes in controls were found in 12 eyes (12%), 0 eye (0%), and 2 eyes (2%), respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the HM group (all P < 0.05). The patterns of asymmetry were affected by steeper staphyloma edges and anastomoses were observed through large trunks and terminal venules. In two eyes with large trunk anastomosis, attenuation of the less dominant vortex vein was observed afterward.\n",

In the five eyes they had progressed to MHRD, the retinal detachment started away from the macular atrophy. Among the 10 eyes which required surgery, there was no significant difference in the presurgical and postsurgical best-corrected visual acuity between the eyes operated because of a worsening of the EMSSRD and the eyes operated because of a progression to MHRD.\n",

However, around the globe, more than 1 billion people are affected by debilitating vision deficits. Therefore, finding a way to treat (or mitigate) them successfully is necessary.\n",

      "METHODS: ES and PL can enhance visual abilities in clinical populations, inducing plastic changes. We describe the experimental set-ups and discuss the results of studies using ES or PL or their combination in order to suggest, based on literature, which treatment is the best option for each clinical condition.\n",
      "RESULTS: Positive results were obtained using ES and PL to enhance visual functions. For example, repetitive transorbital Alternating Current Stimulation (rtACS) appeared as the most effective treatment for pre-chiasmatic disorders such as optic neuropathy. A combination of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and visual training seems helpful for people with hemianopia, while transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) makes visual training more efficient in people with amblyopia and mild myopia.\n",

      "The META-Analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study group proposed a new classification system for myopic maculopathy (MM) with pathologic myopia (PM) defined as MM equal to/more serious than diffuse atrophy or the presence of plus lesions and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) defined as CNV in the eye with PM. However, CNV in elderly eyes with high myopia (HM) not meeting the PM definition (high-myopia CNV) are not classified as age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) or mCNV. This retrospective study included 39 eyes with high-myopia CNV, 20 eyes with mCNV, and 20 eyes with AMD. All patients were at least 40 years old. We compared the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes among three groups. The high-myopia CNV group had significantly more CNV types, shorter axial length and fewer lacquer cracks (P < 0.0001, respectively); larger baseline greatest linear dimension (P = 0.0002), more fellow-eye drusen (P = 0.0106), more men (P = 0.0029), and more treatments (24 months, P = 0.0098) compared to the mCNV group. Compared with the nAMD group, the high-myopia CNV group was significantly younger (P = 0.0041), and had fewer CNV types (P = 0.0316), more lacquer cracks (P = 0.0079) and fewer drusen (affected-eye, P = 0.0006 and fellow-eye, P = 0.0222), and fewer treatments (24 months, P = 0.0030). Because the CNV in elderly eyes with HM not meeting the PM definition is classified as combined mCNV and nAMD, the clinical and angiographic findings are critical to determine the treatment strategy.\n"

      " Non-vasogenic cystoid maculopathies.\n",
      "Besides cystoid macular edema due to a blood-retinal barrier breakdown, another type of macular cystoid spaces referred to as non-vasogenic cystoid maculopathies (NVCM) may be detected on optical coherence tomography but not on fluorescein angiography. Various causes may disrupt retinal cell cohesion or impair retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cell functions in the maintenance of retinal dehydration, resulting in cystoid spaces formation. Tractional causes include vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membranes and myopic foveoschisis. Surgical treatment does not always allow cystoid space resorption. In inherited retinal dystrophies, cystoid spaces may be part of the disease as in X-linked retinoschisis or enhanced S-cone syndrome, or occur occasionally as in bestrophinopathies, retinitis pigmentosa and allied diseases, congenital microphthalmia, choroideremia, gyrate atrophy and Bietti crystalline dystrophy. In macular telangiectasia type 2, cystoid spaces and cavitations do not depend on the fluid leakage from telangiectasia. Various causes affecting RPE function may result in NVCM such as chronic central serous chorioretinopathy and paraneoplastic syndromes. Non-exudative age macular degeneration may also be complicated by intraretinal cystoid spaces in the absence of fluorescein leakage. In these diseases, cystoid spaces occur in a context of retinal cell loss. Various causes of optic atrophy, including open-angle glaucoma, result in microcystoid spaces in the inner nuclear layer due to a retrograde transsynaptic degeneration. Lastly, drug toxicity may also induce cystoid maculopathy. Identifying NVCM on multimodal imaging, including fluorescein angiography if needed, allows guiding the diagnosis of the causative disease and choosing adequate treatment when available.\n"

      " Genetic Polymorphisms in VEGFR Coding Genes (FLT1/KDR) on Ranibizumab Response in High Myopia and Choroidal Neovascularization Patients.\n",
      "A severe form of myopia defined as pathologic/high myopia is the main cause of visual impairment and one of the most frequent causes of blindness worldwide. It is characterized by at least 6 diopters or axial length (AL) of eyeball > 26 mm and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in 5 to 10% of cases. Ranibizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) used in the treatment of CNV. It acts by preventing VEGF-A from interacting with its receptors (VEGFR-1 and -2) encoded by the FLT1 and KDR genes. Several studies found that the KDR and FLT1 genotypes may represent predictive determinants of efficacy in ranibizumab-treated neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGFR coding genes with the response rate to ranibizumab in patients with high myopia and CNV. In the association study of genotypes in FLT1 with the response to ranibizumab, we found a significant association between two FLT1 variants (rs9582036, rs7993418) with ranibizumab efficacy at the 12-month follow-up. About the KDR gene, we found that two KDR variants (rs2305948, rs2071559) are associated with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement and KDR (rs2239702) is associated with lower rates of BCVA worsening considering a 12-month follow-up period.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To grade myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) patients according to the new myopic maculopathy classification (A: atrophy, T: traction, N: neovascularization-ATN) and analyze the correlation in between atrophy, traction and neovascularization.\n",
      "METHODS: Fifty-one eyes of 41 patients with the diagnosis of pathologic myopia and myopic CNV were included in this clinical practice study. Patients were graded according to the recently described ATN classification. Color fundus photographs were used to grade the atrophy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans were used to grade traction and neovascularization. Active myopic CNVs were treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. Chi-square test was used to test the categorical variants and univariate logistic regression analysis was used to predict the independent risk factors of myopic CNV scar formation.\n",
      "RESULTS: Active myopic CNV was observed most frequently in the group with patchy chorioretinal atrophy. Grade of the atrophy and female gender were significantly associated with myopic CNV scar in the univariate logistic regression tests. Multivariate logistic regression showed that atrophy grading is the independent predictor of myopic CNV scar.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: ATN classification is a practical and comprehensive system to grade myopic CNV. Atrophy is an independent predictor for myopic CNV scar and patchy chorioretinal atrophy requires a more careful examination and close follow-up for the risk of CNV development.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To observe the characteristics of highly myopic macular holes (HMMHs) with macular retinoschisis (MRS) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and explore the possible relationship between HMMHs and different types of MRS.\n",
      "METHODS: We consecutively reviewed the clinical data and OCT images of the patients with HMMHs from June 2015 to February 2021. Then we picked eyes with MRS from these HMMHs for analysis. The minimum linear diameter (MLD), basal diameter (BD), and height (H) of HMMHs were measured. HMMHs were grouped according to the extent or layer involvement of the concomitant MRS and the characteristics were compared among groups. The impact of MRS on the MLD of macular hole was analyzed with multivariable linear regression.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included 127 patients with MRS from 168 HMMHs (75.5%) for analysis. According to the different classification systems, the most frequent type of MRS in HMMHs was S3 (foveal but not entire macular area MRS) (62.2%) and both inner- and outer- (I/O-MRS) involved types. In our study, HMMHs with more extensive MRS had larger MLD, larger BD, larger H, and poorer best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Meanwhile, HMMHs with outer layer-involved MRS (outer MRS and I/O-MRS) had larger BD than HMMH with only inner layer-involved MRS. (All P < 0.05) Multivariable linear regression further illustrated only the extent of MRS was significantly associated with the MLD of HMMH, while there was no significant correlation between the involved retinal layers and the MLD of HMMH.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: HMMH with MRS presented as a predominant type in HMMHs. The MRS was always with a relatively large extent and involved both inner and outer layers. MLD of HMMH was mainly affected by the extent of MRS.\n"

      "METHODS: Fundus photos and OCT images were taken for 600 diabetic patients in a community hospital. Ophthalmologists graded these fundus photos according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) Severity Scale as the ground truth. Two existing trained AI models were used to automatically classify the fundus images into DR grades according to ICDR, and to detect concomitant ME from OCT images, respectively. The criteria for referral were DR grades 2-4 and/or the presence of ME. The sensitivity and specificity of AI grading were evaluated. The number of referable DR cases confirmed by ophthalmologists and AI was calculated, respectively.\n",
      "RESULTS: DR was detected in 81 (13.5%) participants by ophthalmologists and in 94 (15.6%) by AI, and 45 (7.5%) and 53 (8.8%) participants were diagnosed with referable DR by ophthalmologists and by AI, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of AI for detecting DR were 91.67%, 96.92% and 0.944, respectively. For detecting referable DR, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of AI were 97.78%, 98.38% and 0.981, respectively.

We aim to examine shared genetic etiology in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, retinal detachment (RD), and myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide association analyses for the five ocular diseases in 43,877 cases and 44,373 controls of European ancestry from UK Biobank, estimated their genetic relationships (LDSC, GNOVA, and Genomic SEM), and identified pleiotropic loci (ASSET and METASOFT).\n",
      "FINDINGS: The genetic correlation of common SNPs revealed a meaningful genetic structure within these diseases, identifying genetic correlations between AMD, DR, and glaucoma. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 23 pleiotropic loci associated with at least two ocular diseases and 14 loci unique to individual disorders (non-pleiotropic). We found that the genes associated with these shared genetic loci are involved in neuron differentiation (P = 8.80 × 10\n",

      "Advances in imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) technology, including the development of swept source OCT/OCTA, widefield or ultra-widefield systems, have greatly improved the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of myopia and myopia-related complications. Anterior segment OCT is useful for imaging the anterior segment of myopes, providing the basis for implantable collamer lens optimization, or detecting intraocular lens decentration in high myopic patients. OCT has enhanced imaging of vitreous properties, and measurement of choroidal thickness in myopic eyes. Widefield OCT systems have greatly improved the visualization of peripheral retinal lesions and have enabled the evaluation of wide staphyloma and ocular curvature. Based on OCT imaging, a new classification system and guidelines for the management of myopic traction maculopathy have been proposed; different dome-shaped macula morphologies have been described; and myopia-related abnormalities in the optic nerve and peripapillary region have been demonstrated. OCTA can quantitatively evaluate the retinal microvasculature and choriocapillaris, which is useful for the early detection of myopic choroidal neovascularization and the evaluation of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in these patients. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence in OCT/OCTA imaging in myopia has achieved promising results.\n",

      "METHODS: A total number of 645 eyes were included. Paravascular microfolds (PMs), paravascular cystoid spaces (PCs), paravascular lamellar holes (PLHs), and retinoschisis were detected using swept-source optical coherence tomography.

A decreasing trend of macular ChT (P < 0.001) was observed in the eyes with PMs only, with both PCs and PMs, and with PLHs, PCs, and PMs. After adjustments for age, sex, and axial length (AL), the presence of PCs, PLHs, or retinoschisis around the optic disc was negatively associated with macular ChT (all P < 0.05). Eyes with longer AL, incomplete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), and myopic atrophic maculopathy (MAM) were more likely to have PCs (all P < 0.01) and retinoschisis around the optic disc (all P < 0.05).\n",

Patients newly receiving intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept from 2000 to 2017 for age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusions, or myopic choroid neovascularization were included as the study group, and patients with same retinal diseases but did not receive intravitreal anti-VEGFs served as controls extracted by age- and sex-matched (1:4) and further propensity score matching (PSM). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of dialysis. A cohort of 2447 anti-VEGF users and 2447 controls by PSM were evaluated. Higher dialysis risks were observed among patients newly receiving anti-VEGF agents compared to controls (adjusted HR: 1.849; 95% CI: 1.378-2.482) in the PSM cohort. For subgroup analysis, patients newly receiving anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic macular edema had significant risk (adjusted HR: 1.834; 95% CI: 1.448-2.324) of becoming dialysis-dependent, while patients in other subgroups demonstrated similar risks as the controls. In conclusion, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents might increase the risk of becoming dialysis-dependent, especially in patients who are treated for diabetic macular edema.\n"

Inner retinoschisis, present in 18 eyes (46%), resolved in all cases after a median time of 1 month. Foveal ORS, present in all cases, resolved in 82% of cases after a median time of 3 months. The FD, present in 23 eyes (59%), resolved in 91% of cases after a median time of 6 months. Extrafoveal ORS resolved in 59% of cases after a median time of 12 months. The mean best-corrected visual acuity significantly improved from 0.80 ± 0.64 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (Snellen Eq 20/148) to 0.48 ± 0.52 logMAR (Snellen Eq 20/70).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Most MFS (80%) are completely resolved during the first year. The decrease in CFT and early resolution of IRS could be used as early biomarkers of surgical success.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To develop deep learning models based on color fundus photographs that can automatically grade myopic maculopathy, diagnose pathologic myopia, and identify and segment myopia-related lesions.\n",
      "METHODS: Photographs were graded and annotated by four ophthalmologists and were then divided into a high-consistency subgroup or a low-consistency subgroup according to the consistency between the results of the graders. ResNet-50 network was used to develop the classification model, and DeepLabv3+ network was used to develop the segmentation model for lesion identification.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between tamsulosin use and surgical complications of cataract surgery in the Korean elderly population.\n",
      "METHODS: This nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study included elderly patients (≥60 years) who had undergone cataract surgery in the period from 2003 to 2015. Baseline characteristics were age, sex, income, residence, and systemic, and ocular comorbidities (glaucoma, myopia, eye trauma, diabetes mellitus with ophthalmic manifestations, severe cataract, age-related macular degeneration).

      "In this study, a one-step electrochemical aptasensor was developed to detect the biomarker vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important protein in the pathogenesis of many retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and retinal vein occlusion. The aptamer has a good affinity and can rapidly identify and capture VEGF based on its unique structure. We designed a VEGF aptasensor based on the aptamer recognition and complex metallo nanoenzyme particles as an electron exchange center and bridge between capture DNA and electrode. The aptamers maintained the hairpin structure to avoid nonspecific surface adsorption and expose the capture sequence outwards when the target was inexistent. Conversely, the aptamers opened the hairpin structure to release space to accomplish binding between VEGF and DNA, resulting in increased impedance. The performance of the electrochemical aptasensor is detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The limit of detection by EIS was as low as 8.2 pg ml\n"

Using fundus photographs taken in 2001 and 2011 and optical coherence tomographic images obtained in 2011, we assessed the incidence and enlargement of pre-existing LC/PAs.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 89 highly myopic eyes (age: 65.0 ± 9.4 years). Newly developed or enlarged LC/PAs were detected in 17 (19.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 11.0, 27.0) eyes, with a new LC development without previous LCs, enlargement of a pre-existing LC, LC enlargement to a PA, development of a new PA without any previous LCs, and enlargement of a pre-existing PA detected in 3, 3, 5, 3, and 3 eyes, respectively. In 14 (82.4%; 95%CI: 62.3, 100) of the 17 eyes with LC/PA development or enlargement, the LC/PAs elongated perpendicularly to, and widened in, the direction of gamma zone enlargement. Higher prevalence of LC/PA enlargement was associated (multivariable analysis) with higher myopic maculopathy stage in 2001 (odds ratio (OR): 7.83; 95%CI: 2.65, 23.2; P < 0.001) and higher frequency of parapapillary delta zone enlargement (OR: 32.0; 95%CI: 3.07, 334; P < 0.001). Prevalence of LC/PA enlargement was lower than the prevalence of changes in other myopic maculopathy features (disc-fovea distance elongation: 71%; choroidal vessel shift: 55%; reduction in ophthalmoscopical disc size: 34%; ophthalmoscopic disc size enlargement: 25%). All eyes with LC/PA enlargement showed a pre-existing and enlarging gamma zone.\n",

      "To determine the differential impact of the irreversible eye diseases on vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in a multi-ethnic Asian population. 2652 participants from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Disease Study, with any of the following early and late-stage eye conditions including age-related macular degeneration (AMD, n = 158), diabetic retinopathy (DR, n = 105; non vision threatening [non-VTDR]; VTDR), glaucoma (n = 57) and myopic macular degeneration (MMD, n = 106), or none of the above (controls, 2226 [83.9%]) were included. Rasch-scaled scores of the Emotional well-being Mobility and Reading subscales of the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire, collectively referred to as \"VRQoL\" were assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses and pairwise comparisons adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, presence of systemic diseases and presenting VI were performed to assess and compare the impact of the presence and severity of each eye condition on the three IVI domains. Multivariable adjusted pairwise comparisons of VRQoL between early stages of the four eye diseases showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05). For late stage diseases, individuals with VTDR had significantly larger decrements in Emotional well-being compared to glaucoma (β - 0.81; 95% CI - 1.47 to - 0.16) and MMD (β - 1.17; 95% CI - 2.16 to - 0.18); and Reading decrements compared to glaucoma (β - 0.66; 95% CI - 1.22 to - 0.11). When compared to late glaucoma, individuals with late AMD (β - 0.76; 95% CI - 1.50 to - 0.01) had significantly larger IVI Mobility subscale decrements. VTDR and late AMD, appear to have the greatest impact on VRQoL, compared to late glaucoma and MMD, suggesting a differential impact of late-stage eye disease categorization on VRQoL.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive factors for myopic macular degeneration (MMD) and progression in adults with myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: We examined 828 Malay and Indian adults (1579 myopic eyes) with myopia (spherical equivalent (SE) ≤-0.5 dioptres) at baseline who participated in both baseline and 12-year follow-up visits of the Singapore Malay Eye Study and the Singapore Indian Eye Study. Eye examinations, including subjective refraction and axial length (AL) measurements, were performed. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia classification. The predictive factors for MMD development and progression were assessed in adults without and with MMD at baseline, respectively as risk ratios (RR) using multivariable modified Poisson regression models. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to visualise the performance of the predictive models for the development of MMD, with performance quantified by the area under the curve (AUC).\n",
      "RESULTS: The 12-year cumulative MMD incidence was 10.3% (95% CI 8.9% to 12.0%) among 1504 myopic eyes without MMD at baseline. Tessellated fundus was a major predictor of MMD (RR=2.50, p<0.001), among other factors including age, worse SE and longer AL (all p<0.001). The AUC for prediction of MMD development was found to be 0.78 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.80) for tessellated fundus and increased significantly to an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.88) with the combination of tessellated fundus with age, race, gender and SE (p<0.001). Older age (p=0.02), worse SE (p<0.001) and longer AL (p<0.001) were found to be predictors of MMD progression.\n",

      "METHODS: The whole-mounted ILM specimens surgically excised from patients with various vitreoretinal diseases (idiopathic macular hole, myopic traction maculopathy, and diabetic retinopathy) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The distribution and morphology of AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 on the ILMs were correlated with immunohistochemical staining characteristics. Moreover, immunofluorescence of AQP4 was performed on the ILM specimens of the patient in four groups: the control group, negative control group, no DME group, and DME group. The immunofluorescence intensity value of AQP4 was measured using ImageJ. The difference between the four groups and the correction between the immunofluorescence value and central foveal thickness (CFT) were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: In IHC sections, the expression of AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 on ILMs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) with macular edema, respectively, seemed to be more abundant than in the idiopathic macular hole (iMH) and myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Moreover, markedly higher fluorescence intensity of AQP4 of ILMs was determined in the DME group (51.05 ± 5.67) versus the other three groups (\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 can be expressed on human ILM in vivo. The increased expression of AQPs on the ILMs of DR may be associated with the occurrence of DME. Moreover, the degree of DME may be positively correlated with the expression of AQP4 on the ILMs.\n"

      " An empirical study of preprocessing techniques with convolutional neural networks for accurate detection of chronic ocular diseases using fundus images.\n",
      "Chronic Ocular Diseases (COD) such as myopia, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataract can affect the eye and may even lead to severe vision impairment or blindness. According to a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report on vision, at least 2.2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from vision impairment. Often, overt signs indicative of COD do not manifest until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. However, if COD is detected early, vision impairment can be avoided by early intervention and cost-effective treatment. Ophthalmologists are trained to detect COD by examining certain minute changes in the retina, such as microaneurysms, macular edema, hemorrhages, and alterations in the blood vessels. The range of eye conditions is diverse, and each of these conditions requires a unique patient-specific treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in multi-disciplinary fields, including the detection of a variety of eye diseases. In this study, we combined several preprocessing approaches with convolutional neural networks to accurately detect COD in eye fundus images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a qualitative analysis of preprocessing approaches for COD classification using CNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that CNNs trained on the region of interest segmented images outperform the models trained on the original input images by a substantial margin. Additionally, an ensemble of three preprocessing techniques outperformed other state-of-the-art approaches by 30% and 3%, in terms of Kappa and \n",

      "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy of MP-3 microperimeter biofeedback fixation training (MBFT) in vision rehabilitation of low-vision patients affected by macular disease with central vision loss.\n",
      "METHODS: Seventeen eyes (7 age-related macular degeneration, 10 myopic maculopathy) of 17 patients were included in this prospective, interventional study. The preferred retinal locus was determined by comprehensive ophthalmoscopic fundus evaluation including fundus photography, autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and microperimetry. The rehabilitation consisted of three 10-min sessions per eye to be performed twice per week for 20 consecutive weeks using the MP-3 microperimeter. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), reading speed, mean central sensitivity, the percentages of fixation points within specified regions, bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA) and the 25-item National Eye Institute visual function questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) were recorded pre- and post-training.\n",
      "RESULTS: The final BCVA, reading speed and mean central sensitivity all showed significant improvements after rehabilitation (P <  0.0001, P = 0.0013, and P = 0.0002, respectively). The percentages of fixation points located within 2° and 4° diameter circles both significantly increased after training (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.0007, respectively).

      "AIM: To present the case of a patient with myopic choroidal neovascular membrane (mCNV) in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, who was treated with intravitreal ranibizumab.\n",
      "CASE REPORT: The 34-year-old patient was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady in January 2020 for mCNV on her right eye (RE). The patient was in the 34th week of pregnancy. Initial best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 68 ETDRS letters. Spherical equivalent of the RE was -11.5 dioptres, axial length of the RE was 27.7 mm. Pigmented CNV with small haemorrhage was present on the retina of the RE. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the RE showed a hyperreflective mass above the retinal pigment epithelium, central retinal thickness (CRT) was 310 µm. OCT angiography confirmed the presence of a classic CNV in the macula of the RE. Two weeks later, the hyperreflective lesion and oedema in the macula of the RE increased, the CRT was 329 µm, BCVA remained stable. After discussion with the patient and the treating gynaecologist, intravitreal ranibizumab was administered in the RE in the 36th week of pregnancy. On check-up 3 weeks later, we observed the decrease of macular oedema to 276 µm and the improvement of BCVA to 78 ETDRS letters. The patient delivered a healthy baby girl in the 39th week of pregnancy via caesarean section, postnatal adaptation of the newborn was normal. During further visits, the BCVA improved to 83 ETDRS letters and the macular oedema disappeared completely. 8 months after the first ranibizumab injection, the CNV reactivated, BCVA decreased to 72 ETDRS letters, oedema was present in the macula and the CRT was 309 µm. Another ranibizumab was administered into the RE. The patient then discovered that she was pregnant; according to calculations, she was in the 3rd week of pregnancy at the time of the second ranibizumab injection. After the second injection, BCVA improved to 79 ETDRS letters, macular oedema on the OCT disappeared and CRT decreased to 264 µm. The pregnancy was terminated per patients request.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Intravitreal administration of ranibizumab in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy led to the improvement of BCVA and decrease of macular oedema in the patient with mCNV. The injection had no adverse effect on the pregnancy or the postnatal adaptation of the newborn. However, it is always necessary to consider the risk/benefit ratio when administering intravitreal antiVEGF drugs in pregnant patients. Thorough discussion with the patient is necessary.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The aim is to determine the retinal changes in patients with Stickler syndrome caused by a p.R565C missense mutation of the \n",
      "METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records of 10 eyes of six patients from two families with the Stickler syndrome. The members of both families were heterozygous for the p.R565C mutation. The clinical features including the visual acuity, fundus appearances, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images, and electroretinograms were examined.\n",
      "RESULTS: Myopia of -12 diopters (D) to -24 D with an average of -16.8 D was observed in 9 eyes of the 5 patients. The FAF images showed different degrees of hyper and hypoautofluorescent patterns in the macula in all but the two youngest patients (7 of 9 eyes, 78%). The OCT images showed the absence of a foveal pit and destruction of the outer retinal layers in the macular area in all patients. The ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the macular region was disrupted in eight eyes (80%) of which seven were fovea sparing.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Two families with Stickler syndrome with the p.R565C mutation showed more severe foveal hypoplasia, macular degeneration, and extensive retinal degeneration. A correlation of the OCT and FAF images with the genotype is helpful in determining the prognosis of Stickler syndrome.\n"

      " The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among ophthalmic disease patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Progressive and irreversible vision loss has been shown to place a patient at risk of mental health problems such as anxiety. However, the reported prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among eye disease patients vary across studies. Thus, this study aims to clarify the estimated prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among ophthalmic disease patients.\n",
      "METHODS: Relevant studies on the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among eye disease patients were collected through international databases, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A random-effects model was used to determine the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders among ophthalmic disease patients.\n",
      "RESULTS: The 95 included studies yielded a pooled prevalence of 31.2% patients with anxiety symptoms and 19.0% with anxiety disorders among subjects with ophthalmic disease. Pediatric patients were more anxious (58.6%) than adults (29%). Anxiety symptoms were most prevalent in uveitis (53.5%), followed by dry eye disease (DED, 37.2%), retinitis pigmentosa (RP, 36.5%), diabetic retinopathy (DR, 31.3%), glaucoma (30.7%), myopia (24.7%), age-related macular degeneration (AMD, 21.6%), and cataract (21.2%) patients. Anxiety disorders were most prevalent in thyroid eye disease (TED, 28.9%), followed by glaucoma (22.2%) and DED (11.4%). When compared with healthy controls, there was a twofold increase on the prevalence of anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.912, 95% CI 1.463-2.5, \n",
      "CONCLUSION: Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common problems associated with ophthalmic disease patients. Thus, comprehensive and appropriate treatments are necessary for treating anxiety symptoms and disorders among ophthalmic disease patients.\n"

      " Vitamin D and Ocular Diseases: A Systematic Review.\n",
      "The contributory roles of vitamin D in ocular and visual health have long been discussed, with numerous studies pointing to the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of recent findings on the association between vitamin D and different ocular diseases, including myopia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), dry eye syndrome (DES), thyroid eye disease (TED), uveitis, retinoblastoma (RB), cataract, and others, from epidemiological, clinical and basic studies, and briefly discuss vitamin D metabolism in the eye. We searched two research databases for articles examining the association between vitamin D deficiency and different ocular diseases. One hundred and sixty-two studies were found. There is evidence on the association between vitamin D and myopia, AMD, DR, and DES. Overall, 17 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and AMD, while 48 out of 54 studies reported that vitamin D was associated with DR, and 25 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and DES. However, the available evidence for the association with other ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, TED, and RB, remains limited.\n",

      " Intact quantitative bioanalytical method development and fit-for-purpose validation of a monoclonal antibody and its related fab fragment in human vitreous and aqueous humor using LC-HRMS.\n",
      "Ranibizumab is an FDA-approved drug used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and myopic choroidal neovascularization. Bevacizumab is another drug often used off-label to treat wet AMD. In order to reduce unwanted angiogenesis, ranibizumab and bevacizumab target circulating VEGF-A in the eye. Concentration levels in human vitreous and aqueous humor can be used to provide valuable efficacy information. However, vitreous and aqueous humor's aqueous environment, and vitreous humor's viscosity, as well as the stickiness of the analytes can provide bioanalytical challenges. In this manuscript, we describe the development, optimization, and fit-for-purpose validation of an LC-HRMS method designed for intact quantitative bioanalysis of ranibizumab and bevacizumab in human vitreous and aqueous humor following intravitreal administration. In order to fully develop this method, evaluations were conducted to optimize the conditions, including the data processing model (extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) vs deconvolution), carryover mitigation, sample preparation scheme optimization for surrogate and primary matrices, use of internal standard/immunocapture/deglycosylation, and optimization of the extraction and dilution procedure, as well as optimization of the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry conditions. Once the method was fully optimized, a fit-for-purpose validation was conducted, including matrix parallelism, with a linear calibration range of 10 to 200 µg/mL. The development of this intact quantitative method using LC-HRMS provides a proof-of-concept template for challenging, but valuable new and exciting bioanalytical techniques.\n"

      " Long-term surgical outcomes and prognostic factors of foveal detachment in pathologic myopia: based on the ATN classification.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To investigate the long-term surgical outcomes and prognostic factors of foveal detachment (FD) in pathological myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 59 patients with FD (61 eyes) who underwent pars plana vitrectomy at Shanghai General Hospital between June 2017 and July 2018 with follow-up for at least 24 months. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and swept-source optical coherence tomography, were assessed. Preoperative myopic maculopathy was evaluated according to the ATN classification.\n",
      "RESULTS: FD completely resolved in 59 of 61 eyes (96.7%). Mean duration of retinal reattachment was 12.10 ± 8.10 months. Mean logMAR BCVA improved from 1.34 ± 0.52 to 0.83 ± 0.43 at 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.001). Secondary macular hole occurred in 8 eyes (13.1%) with a mean period of 3.4 ± 4.1 weeks after primary surgery. In regression analyses, baseline myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM) (B = 0.213, P = 0.005) and vitreomacular traction (VMT) (B = 0.292, P = 0.007) were adverse prognostic factors for postoperative BCVA. A more severe MAM revealed a delay in retinal reattachment (B = 5.670, P = 0.002). FD eyes with VMT (OR = 1.309, P = 0.003) or outer lamellar macular hole (O-LMH) (OR = 1.369, P < 0.001) were risk factors for postoperative secondary macular hole.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy was effective in the long-term for treating FD. Careful consideration is needed for those with VMT or O-LMH due to the high risk of secondary macular hole after vitrectomy. FD eyes with more severe MAM tended to have poorer postoperative BCVA and extended periods of retinal reattachment.\n"

      " Proteome Changes Associated with the VEGFR Pathway and Immune System in Diabetic Macular Edema Patients at Different Diabetic Retinopathy Stages.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a major cause of vision loss in all stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, there is limited recognition of aqueous humor (AH) proteome profiles of DME patients at different DR stages. In this study, we aimed to investigate the AH proteome changes between DME patients at the nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) stage and those at the proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) stage.\n",
      "METHODS: A label-free data-independent acquisition based liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed to profile the abundances of AH proteins in 73 eyes from DME patients at different DR stages. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to confirm the proteomics results with AH samples from non-diabetic patients and DME patients at the NPDR or PDR stage.\n",
      "RESULTS: LC-MS/MS results showed significantly changed expression of 308 proteins between DME patients in the NPDR and PDR groups. Compared to the NPDR group, the proteins relatively up-regulated in the PDR group are involved in the immune system and/or negative regulation of the cell cycle, while proteins relatively down-regulated in the PDR group are associated with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) pathway and/or metabolism. ELISA results further verified the proteomic result of down-regulated expression of the immune-associated protein cystatin C (CST3) in the PDR group compared to that in the NPDR and non-diabetic groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we reported for the first time the decreased abundances of AH proteins associated with the VEGFR pathway and both down- and up-regulated expression of AH proteins associated with the immune system in the PDR group compared to that in the NPDR group. Furthermore, we found negative correlations of immune-associated protein, CST3 concentration in AH with DR severity and central retinal thickness, suggesting CST3 as a promising target independent of the VEGFR pathway in DME-involved DR treatment.\n"

      " [Visual impairment and blindness caused by posterior segment diseases in Hungary in people aged 50 years and older].\n",
      "Introduction: Posterior segment diseases are the most common causes of blindness and visual impairment in devel-oped countries among people aged 50 years and older in Hungary. Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of visual impairment and blindness caused by posterior segment diseases in the population aged 50 years and older in Hungary. Method: 105 census enumeration units were randomly selected with a probability proportional to size by the Hungar-ian Central Statistical Office. The standardised Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) method was used. Participants underwent eye examination with a direct ophthalmoscope. Participants underwent visual acuity testing with a Snellen tumbling E-chart with or without a pinhole. Dilated fundus examination was performed in diabetic participants using an indirect binocular ophthalmoscope. Results: In total, 3523 (95.9%) out of 3675 eligible people were examined, of whom the prevalence of bilateral blind-ness and severe visual impairment was 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively. The most common causes of visual impairment caused by posterior segment diseases were age-related macular degeneration (1.419%), glaucoma (0.397%), diabetic retinopathy (0.341%) and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (0.198%). The most common causes of blindness caused by posterior segment diseases were age-related macular degeneration (37.5%), glaucoma (16.7%), diabetic retinopathy (8.3%), high myopia (8.3%), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (8.3%) and retinitis pigmentosa (8.3%). Conclusion: Prevalence of severe visual impairment and blindness caused by posterior segment diseases was lower compared to results of RAAB surveys in other countries. The frequency order of different posterior segment diseases was in line with developed countries. Availability of eye care should be improved and financing should be modernized due to the continuously increasing number of patients with age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetes and pathologic myopia.\n"

      " Optic pit-like maculopathy in a patient without any detectable disc anomalies.\n",
      "Macular schisis is the splitting of the inner retinal layers at macula, with or without associated detachment. The acquired form of macular schisis is frequently associated with optic disc pit maculopathy, although it could be accompanied by several conditions such as tractional maculopathies, cystoid macular edema, veno-occlusive disease, and shaken baby syndrome. However, a small number of cases of retinoschisis without optic disc pit have been reported elsewhere. Here, we present a patient with acquired macular schisis without high myopia and optic disc abnormality in funduscopic examination and imaging. Macular optical coherence tomography of her left eye revealed schisis of the inner and outer retinal layers and subretinal fluid and choroidal thickness of 426 μm (pachychoroid). Although the optic disc of this patient appeared normal, the probable presumption is that small junctions existed between the macular neuroretinal tissue and the vitreous cavity. Further studies are required to survey the other probable mechanisms of retinoschisis without optic pit with more subjects.\n",

      " An evidence-based review of the epidemiology of myopic traction maculopathy.\n",
      "Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), one of the complications of pathologic myopia, is a spectrum of pathological conditions that are attributed to tractional changes in the eye characterized by retinoschisis, lamellar or full thickness macular hole, and foveal retinal detachment. Considering the global public health burden of MTM and pathologic myopia, it is important to understand these sight-threatening complications and their associations. We conducted an evidence-based review of the prevalence and natural history of MTM and associated risk factors. The prevalence of MTM in the general population is low, but is increased among high myopes. MTM is associated with preretinal tractional structures, myopic refractive error and axial elongation, posterior staphyloma, dome-shaped macula, chorioretinal atrophy, and myopic macular degeneration. The clinical course of MTM tends to be stable; however, MTM may progress, resulting in visual acuity deterioration, although spontaneous improvement also occurs. The associations of MTM progression include vitreous traction, location, and extent of MTM, and lamellar macular hole-specific factors. More high-quality population-based studies that assess MTM prevalence and natural history are needed.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Myopic maculopathy (MM) has become a major cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide, especially in East Asian countries. Deep learning approaches such as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been successfully applied to identify some common retinal diseases and show great potential for the intelligent analysis of MM. This study aimed to build a reliable approach for automated detection of MM from retinal fundus images using DCNN models.\n",
      "METHODS: A dual-stream DCNN (DCNN-DS) model that perceives features from both original images and corresponding processed images by color histogram distribution optimization method was designed for classification of no MM, tessellated fundus (TF), and pathologic myopia (PM). A total of 36,515 gradable images from four hospitals were used for DCNN model development, and 14,986 gradable images from the other two hospitals for external testing. We also compared the performance of the DCNN-DS model and four ophthalmologists on 3000 randomly sampled fundus images.\n",
      "RESULTS: The DCNN-DS model achieved sensitivities of 93.3% and 91.0%, specificities of 99.6% and 98.7%, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.998 and 0.994 for detecting PM, whereas sensitivities of 98.8% and 92.8%, specificities of 95.6% and 94.1%, AUCs of 0.986 and 0.970 for detecting TF in two external testing datasets. In the sampled testing dataset, the sensitivities of four ophthalmologists ranged from 88.3% to 95.8% and 81.1% to 89.1%, and the specificities ranged from 95.9% to 99.2% and 77.8% to 97.3% for detecting PM and TF, respectively. Meanwhile, the DCNN-DS model achieved sensitivities of 90.8% and 97.9% and specificities of 99.1% and 94.0% for detecting PM and TF, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DCNN-DS approach demonstrated reliable performance with high sensitivity, specificity, and AUC to classify different MM levels on fundus photographs sourced from clinics. It can help identify MM automatically among the large myopic groups and show great potential for real-life applications.\n",

      "DESIGN: Population-based study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5894 adults (2141 Chinese, 1913 Indian, and 1840 Malay) from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study were included in the analysis. The mean ± standard deviation age was 57.05 ± 9.31 years. A total of 361 adults had a diagnosis of HM (spherical equivalent [SE] < -5.00 diopters [D]) from refraction measurements, 240 individuals had a diagnosis of MMD graded by the International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy criteria from fundus photographs, and 3774 individuals were control participants without myopia (SE > -0.5 D).\n",
      "METHODS: The PRS, derived from 687 289 HapMap3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the largest genome-wide association study of myopia in Europeans to date (n = 260 974), was assessed on its ability to predict patients with HM and MMD versus control participants.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to predict HM and MMD.\n",
      "RESULTS: The PRS had an AUC of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.75) for HM and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.63-0.70) for MMD versus no myopia. The inclusion of the PRS with other predictors (age, sex, educational attainment [EA], and ancestry; age-by-ancestry, sex-by-ancestry, and EA-by-ancestry interactions; and 20 genotypic principal components) increased the AUC to 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) for HM and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82) for MMD. Individuals with a PRS in the top 5% showed up to a 4.66 (95% CI, 3.34-6.42) times higher risk of HM developing and up to a 3.43 (95% CI, 2.27-5.05) times higher risk of MMD developing compared with the remaining 95% of individuals.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The PRS is a good predictor for HM and facilitates the identification of high-risk children to prevent myopia progression to HM. In addition, the PRS also predicts MMD and helps to identify high-risk adults with myopia who require closer monitoring for myopia-related complications.\n"

      " A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for myopic macular degeneration.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopic macular degeneration (MMD) is a primary cause of blindness and visual impairment in many parts of the world. A review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for intervention selection are required with the increasing demand for MMD management in clinical practice as well as in national health services. Therefore, we aim to systematically review CPGs for MMD and assist the recommendations development of the Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI) program of the World Health Organization.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic review of CPGs published on MMD between 2010 and April 2020 was conducted. Guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. Cochrane systematic reviews were also included when the evidence from included CPGs were inadequate or contradict.\n",
      "RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria and conducting the quality appraisal, two CPGs were finally included. The average of the AGREE II ratings for the identified Guidelines were 56 and 63 respectively (7 for each item). To provide further information on interventions for MMD, one Cochrane review on MMD was additionally identified and included in the study. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs were recommended for patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) as first-line therapy to improve vision and reduce central macular thickness, and ranibizumab showed significant effectiveness compared to photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT was recommended to be performed in those resistant to the treatment by one CPG but lacked of adequate description and support. Data extracted from the Cochrane systematic reviews indicated that anti-VEGF therapy for mCNV had significant effectiveness in improving visual acuity and reducing CMT compared to PDT with moderate to low certainty of evidence. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were considered as equally effective with moderate certainty.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this review suggest that high quality clinical practice guidelines for MMD management are limited. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents was recommended as an effective intervention to treat myopic CNV as the first-line treatment, while there was inadequate guidance for the application of PDT in myopic CNV management.

      " CHANGES IN MYOPIC MACULOPATHY BASED ON ATN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM: An Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess changes in myopic maculopathy based on the ATN classification system with optical coherence tomography angiography.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. The macular choroidal thickness (MCT) and the choriocapillaris flow (CC) were measured with optical coherence tomography angiography. The relationship of MCT and CC with different chorioretinal atrophy (A), myopic foveoschisis (T), and myopic neovascularization (N) grades was investigated.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three participates (219 eyes) were included. MCT and CC had no significant correlation with different T grades (P > 0.05). Choriocapillaris flow had a significant decrease in eyes with lacquer cracks compared with those with no neovascular maculopathy (P < 0.05) and showed a significant increase in active choroidal neovascularization compared with those with lacquer cracks (P < 0.05). Macular choroidal thickness and CC had negative correlations with different A grades (P < 0.001). MCT showed the greatest decrease in the early stage of myopic atrophic maculopathy (P < 0.001), and CC showed the most significant reduction in the late stage (P < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Choroidal changes in the highly myopic patients were detected by optical coherence tomography angiography. Progressive ischemia in the macula may play an important role in the development of myopic atrophic maculopathy. Active choroidal neovascularization may have manifested as compensation for the decrease in MCT and CC. On the contrary, myopic traction maculopathy had little correlation with choroidal changes.\n"

      " Prevalence and determinants of reticular pseudodrusen in the Russian Ural Eye and Medical Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and their determinants.\n",
      "METHODS: The Population-based Ural Eye and Medical Study conducted in Bashkortostan/Russia included 5899 participants aged 40+ years. Presence of RPDs was assessed on conventional colour fundus photographs, red-free fundus images and optical coherence tomographic images.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 4914 (83.3%) individuals (mean age: 58.5 ± 10.5 years; range: 40-94 years). Using two age limits (>55 years and 40+ years) for the definitions of RPD and AMD (age-related macular degeneration), RPD prevalence was 186/4914 (3.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.3, 4.3) and 246/4914 (5.0%, 95% CI: 4.4, 5.6), respectively, and the prevalence of any AMD without RPD was 182/4914 (3.7%: 95% CI: 3.2, 4.2) and 224/4914 (4.6%; 95% CI: 4.0, 5.1) respectively. Within the subgroup of early AMD, intermediate AMD and late AMD, RPD prevalence (age limit: 40+ years) was 55.1% (95% CI: 49.5, 60.8), 42.9% (95% CI: 33.8, 51.9) and 33.3% (95% CI: 16.4, 50.3) respectively. In multivariable analysis, higher RPD prevalence (age limit 40+ years) was associated with higher age (odds ratio (OR): 1.08; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.10; p < 0.001), rural region of habitation (OR: 3.81; 95% CI: 2.76, 5.24; p < 0.001) and lower percentage of lymphocytes on leukocyte counts (OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.97; p < 0.001). Higher prevalence of any AMD without RPD was associated with urban region (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.11; p = 0.002), lower diabetes prevalence (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.90; p = 0.02) and shorter axial length (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.98; p = 0.03), after adjusting for age.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Reticular pseudodrusen (mean prevalence: 3.8% (age limit >55 years); 5.0% (age limit 40+ years)) differs from AMD without RPD in its association with urban region (AMD without RPD: rural region), lower lymphocyte percentage (AMD without RPD: no association) and a lack of associations with axial length (AMD without RPD: shorter axial length) and with diabetes prevalence (AMD without RPD: lower diabetes prevalence).\n"

      " Association between Different Grades of Myopic Tractional Maculopathy and OCT-Based Macular Scleral Deformation.\n",
      "Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of macular outward scleral height (MOSH) in different grades of myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM) and explore the risk factors for MTM. Methods: A total of 188 eyes (188 participants) with high myopia were divided into the no MTM (nMTM) group and the MTM group, which was further graded into foveoschisis, foveal detachment, full-thickness macular hole, and macular hole with retinal detachment. Swept-source optical coherence tomography was used to measure the MOSH. Results: No significant differences were found in axial length between the nMTM and MTM groups (p = 0.295). The MOSH was significantly higher in the MTM group (p < 0.001), which was identified as a risk factor for MTM (OR = 1.108, p < 0.001). The proportion of eyes with severe atrophic myopic maculopathy (AMM) was higher in the MTM group (28.48%) (p = 0.003). The macular hole with foveoschisis (MH/FS+) subgroup presented a higher average MOSH (p = 0.012) and more severe AMM (p = 0.009) than the macular hole without foveoschisis (MH/FS−) subgroup. Conclusion: MOSH would be more suitable for estimating MTM occurrence than axial length. The grading of AMM helps to evaluate the severity of MTM. The categorization of MH/FS− as a distinct grade from MH/FS+ might be preferable.\n",

      "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive factors for postoperative visual acuity improvement (PVAI) in subjects who underwent phakic intraocular lens implantation with a central hole (ICL-V4c) for ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Eyes with ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D undergoing ICL-V4c implantation were studied. Univariable linear regression models were used to assess the association between PVAI and preoperative parameters. Myopic maculopathy was classified into 5 categories by fundus photography. After the 1-month follow-up, the PVAI was compared within different age and preoperative spherical degree groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: This study included 726 eyes from 419 patients (111 men and 308 women), and the mean age, spherical refraction, and axial length were 28.67 ± 7.93 years, - 13.61 ± 3.44 D, and 28.59 ± 1.50 mm, respectively. At baseline, myopic maculopathy was classified (grades C0-C4) as follows: C0 was observed in 200 eyes (27.5%), C1 in 297 eyes (40.9%), C2 in 147 eyes (20.2%), C3 in 22 eyes (3.0%), and C4 in 60 eyes (8.3%). The PVAI was significantly negatively associated with age and positively associated with SD-pre(-Sph), but no significant association between myopic maculopathy classification and axial length was found. After 1 month, 417 eyes (57.4%) gained more than 1 line at BCVA, 250 eyes (34.4%) remained the same, and 59 eyes (8.13%) lost 1 line. The postoperative visual acuity of 52 eyes was improved by more than 3 lines, and 42.3% were grade C4.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The ICL performed well for the correction of ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D. Younger patients and those with a higher preoperative spherical degree had greater postoperative satisfaction.\n",

      " Predicting Optical Coherence Tomography-Derived High Myopia Grades From Fundus Photographs Using Deep Learning.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can predict optical coherence tomography (OCT)-derived high myopia grades based on fundus photographs.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1,853 qualified fundus photographs obtained from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) were selected to develop an AI system. Three retinal specialists assessed corresponding OCT images to label the fundus photographs. We developed a novel deep learning model to detect and predict myopic maculopathy according to the atrophy (A), traction (T), and neovascularisation (N) classification and grading system. Furthermore, we compared the performance of our model with that of ophthalmologists.\n",
      "RESULTS: When evaluated on the test set, the deep learning model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.969 for category A, 0.895 for category T, and 0.936 for category N. The average accuracy of each category was 92.38% (A), 85.34% (T), and 94.21% (N). Moreover, the performance of our AI system was superior to that of attending ophthalmologists and comparable to that of retinal specialists.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our AI system achieved performance comparable to that of retinal specialists in predicting vision-threatening conditions in high myopia via simple fundus photographs instead of fundus and OCT images. The application of this system can save the cost of patients' follow-up, and is more suitable for applications in less developed areas that only have fundus photography.\n",

      " Pathologic myopia: advances in imaging and the potential role of artificial intelligence.\n",
      "Pathologic myopia is a severe form of myopia that can lead to permanent visual impairment. The recent global increase in the prevalence of myopia has been projected to lead to a higher incidence of pathologic myopia in the future. Thus, imaging myopic eyes to detect early pathological changes, or predict myopia progression to allow for early intervention, has become a key priority. Recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) have contributed to the new grading system for myopic maculopathy and myopic traction maculopathy, which may improve phenotyping and thus, clinical management. Widefield fundus and OCT imaging has improved the detection of posterior staphyloma. Non-invasive OCT angiography has enabled depth-resolved imaging for myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great performance in detecting pathologic myopia and the identification of myopia-associated complications. These advances in imaging with adjunctive AI analysis may lead to improvements in monitoring disease progression or guiding treatments. In this review, we provide an update on the classification of pathologic myopia, how imaging has improved clinical evaluation and management of myopia-associated complications, and the recent development of AI algorithms to aid the detection and classification of pathologic myopia.\n"

      "There is a growing body of literature on the effects of sleep disorders, in particular obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), on ocular health, with consistent evidence of an increased risk of floppy eyelid syndrome, non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, diabetic macular oedema, and other retinal vasculature changes in individuals with OSA. However, reports on OSA's associations with glaucoma, papilloedema, diabetic retinopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, and keratoconus have been conflicting, while links between OSA and age-related macular degeneration have only been described fairly recently. Despite numerous suggestions that OSA treatment may reduce risk of these eye diseases, well-designed studies to support these claims are lacking. In particular, the ocular hypertensive effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for OSA requires further investigation into its potential impact on glaucoma risk and management. Reports of ocular surface complications secondary to leaking CPAP masks highlights the importance of ensuring good mask fit. Poor sleep habits have also been linked with increased myopia risk; however, the evidence on this association remains weak.\n"

      " Fine particulate matter measured by satellites predicts the risk of age-related macular degeneration in a longitudinal cohort study.\n",
      "Although studies have revealed that ambient particulate matter (PM) has detrimental effects on the ocular surface, there have been limited reports detailing the effect of ambient PM on the posterior segment of the eye. A large-scale longitudinal cohort study evaluating the association between fine PM, especially PM2.5, and the retina could elucidate the risk of ambient pollutants for retinal diseases. We investigated the association between PM2.5 and the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We conducted a population-based cohort study of 4,284,128 participants in Taiwan between 2001 and 2011. PM2.5 was continuously measured by satellites and subsequently assigned to each geographic district along with its postcode. A time-dependent Cox proportional-hazard model was used to assess the overall effects of average PM2.5. We used distributed lag non-linear models to evaluate the dose-response relationship between PM2.5 and AMD development. The annual mean of PM2.5 exposure was 34.23 ± 7.17 μg/m3. The PM2.5 concentrations were highest in spring, followed by those in winter, autumn, and summer. Twelve thousand ninety-five new AMD cases were reported during the study period. After adjusting for covariates, the AMD risk increased by 19% (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.25) for a 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 increase. The present study demonstrated that chronic exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk of AMD. Almost half of the Taiwanese live in a polluted area where the PM2.5 levels are higher than the World Health Organization recommended air quality guideline of 10 μg/m3 had a 1.4-fold risk, which significantly increases concern about their visual health and social burden.\n",

      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to introduce stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis (SNIFR) and its differential diagnosis. We summarize findings from case reports and series published in the last few years on the clinical and imaging findings in SNIFR.\n",
      "RECENT FINDINGS: SNIFR presents as either a unilateral or bilateral macular star on fundus examination without clinical or imaging evidence of exudation or frank vitreomacular traction. optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging shows schisis cavities in the Henle fibre and outer plexiform layers that correspond to the stellate en face findings. Visual acuity is usually minimally affected, and the presence of significant vision loss should prompt high clinical suspicion for alternate diagnoses.\n",
      "SUMMARY: SNIFR is a recently characterized clinical entity that serves as an important addition to the differential diagnosis of a macular star. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be distinguished from other causes of macular star such as neuroretinitis, vitreomacular traction, ocular manifestations of malignant hypertension, congenital juvenile X-linked macular schisis, myopic maculopathy, optic pit maculopathy, nicotinic acid maculopathy or taxane maculopathy among others.\n"

      "PURPOSE: The proportion of axial length (AL) occupied by vitreous chamber depth (VCD), or VCD:AL, consistently correlates to ocular biometry in the general population. Relation of VCD:AL to ocular biometry in high myopia is not known. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relation of VCD and VCD:AL to ocular biometry of highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study of records of 214 myopic eyes (<-1 D SE, aged 20-40 years) attending the refractive surgery services. High axial myopia was defined as AL >26.5 mm. Eyes with posterior staphyloma and myopic maculopathy were excluded. Records were assessed for measurements of AL, central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), white to white diameter (WTW), and vitreous chamber depth (VCD). Groups were formed based on increasing AL, while the sum of CCT, ACD, and LT was recorded as anterior segment depth (AS). The main outcome measure was the correlation of VCD and VCD:AL to ocular biometry. A comparison was also performed based on of degree of axial myopia.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 27.0 ± 5.2 years. VCD showed a very strong correlation with AL (R = 0.98, P < 0.001) but did not correlate to any anterior parameter. VCD:AL showed moderate negative relation with AS (R = -0.43, P < 0.001) and ACD (R = -0.3, P < 0.001), while it had a weakly negative relation with LT (R = -0.18, P = 0.006). VCD:AL showed strong negative relation (R > ~0.7) with AS in all individual groups of AL. Among anterior parameters, WTW showed the most consistent relation with ocular biometry.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: VCD:AL is a better correlate of ocular biometry in high myopia as compared to VCD. However, the correlation is weaker than that noted by previous studies done on the general population. Longitudinal studies of VCD:AL in the younger age group is recommended.\n",

      " Choriocapillaris Changes in Myopic Macular Degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Myopic macular degeneration (MMD) can cause irreversible vision loss. Thinner choroid is associated with increased MMD severity. This cross-sectional study analyzed choriocapillaris (CC) alterations in MMD.\n",
      "METHODS: Axial length (AL), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus photography, and swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) were assessed in controls and high myopes (spherical equivalent ≤ -6 diopters). Myopic patients with grade 2 MMD (macular diffuse chorioretinal atrophy [MDCA]), high axial myopia (AL ≥ 26.5 mm), and BCVA ≥ 20/40 were compared with controls without MMD. CC mean thickness was measured from 3 × 3-mm SS-OCTA scans by identifying CC peaks in A-scan intensity profiles. CC flow deficit percent (CC FD%) was quantified using a fuzzy C-mean local thresholding method on en face OCTA images. Multivariate regressions compared CC thickness and CC FD% between myopic patients and controls, correcting for age and other confounders.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixteen eyes with MDCA (AL, 26.96-33.93 mm; ages, 40-78 years) were compared with 51 control eyes (AL, 21.65-25.84 mm; ages, 19-88 years). CC thickness in patients with MDCA was 66% lower than that in controls (5.23 ± 0.68 µm [mean ± SD] vs. 15.46 ± 1.82 µm; P < 0.001). CC FD% in patients with MDCA was 237% greater than in controls (26.5 ± 4.3 vs. 11.2 ± 4.6; P < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MDCA with good visual acuity had thinner CC and increased CC FD%, or reduced CC flow, compared with controls. Patients with grade 2 MMD and good visual acuity demonstrated significant choriocapillaris alterations, suggesting that choriocapillaris perfusion defects contribute to the pathogenesis of MMD.\n",

      "This observational cohort study aimed to evaluate the progression pattern of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (DCA) according to its severity. Highly myopic eyes with DCA were graded according to its extent in the 532-nm (green) and 633-nm (red) wavelengths images of the Optos ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscope at baseline: grade 1 and 2 were defined when increased reflectance at peripapillary region, not beyond the fovea, were observed in red laser image only and in both laser images, respectively; grade 3 and 4 were defined when increased reflectance beyond the fovea were observed in red laser image only and in both laser images, respectively. A total of 307 eyes (221 patients) were included, and progression of myopic maculopathy during follow-up of ≥ 3 years was evaluated. The mean visual acuity and subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT) differed among DCA grades (P = 0.015 and P < 0.001); a higher DCA grade had worse visual acuity and thinner choroid. During follow-up, development of patchy atrophy (PA) was observed in 3.2%, 5.5%, 12.8%, and 23.2% (P < 0.001), while changes in lacquer crack (LC) and/or development of myopic macular neovascularization were observed in 20.6%, 29.1%, 33.3%, and 15.8% (P = 0.061) of 63, 110, 39, and 95 eyes with DCA grade of 1, 2, 3, and 4 at baseline, respectively. New LC formation tended to occur in eyes with thicker CT at baseline compared to PA development and progression of pre-existing LC. In highly myopic eyes with DCA, progression pattern of myopic maculopathy is different according to its severity and CT at baseline. Grading based on separated wavelength images of ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscope is useful to evaluate the severity and prognosis of DCA in Asian patients with high myopia.\n"

      " Parapapillary gamma zone enlargement in a 10-year follow-up: the Beijing Eye Study 2001-2011.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess prevalence and associated factors of parapapillary gamma zone enlargement (GZE).\n",
      "METHODS: Using fundus photographs and optical coherence tomographic images of participants of the population-based Beijing Eye Study, we examined gamma zone changes in a 10-year follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 89 highly myopic eyes (61 participants; age: 65.0 ± 9.8 years) and 86 randomly selected non-highly myopic eyes. GZE prevalence was significantly higher in highly myopic eyes than non-highly myopic eyes (75/89; 84%; 95% CI: 77, 92 versus 18/86; 21%; 95% CI:12, 30; p < 0.001). None of the eyes showed a reduction in gamma zone size. Higher prevalence of segmental GZE without enlargement of Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) (mean: 26/175; 14.9%; 95% CI: 9.5, 20.2) was associated with optic disc size reduction (OR: 43.3; 95% CI: 10.9, 172; p < 0.001), disc-fovea distance elongation (OR: 15.4; 95% CI: 3.12, 76.4; p = 0.001) and lower prevalence of high axial myopia (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.44; p = 0.001). Higher prevalence of circular GZE (mean: 38/175; 21.7%; 95% CI: 16, 28) was correlated with optic disc enlargement (OR: 4.30; 95% CI: 1.58, 11.7; p = 0.004), and higher prevalence of myopic maculopathy progression (OR: 4.04; 95% CI: 1.60, 10.2; p = 0.003), or alternatively, higher prevalence of high myopia (OR: 4.44; 95% CI: 1.76, 11.2; p = 0.002). Circular GZE or BMO enlargement was associated with lower prevalence of macular BM defect enlargement (p = 0.035). GZE occurred perpendicular to the orientation of myopic lacquer cracks in 12 out of 17 (71%; 95% CI: 46, 95) eyes with lacquer cracks. Segmental GZE occurred in 49 (89%) out of 55 eyes in the same direction as shortening of the disc diameter developed.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The observations support the possibility of a posterior myopic axial elongation-associated BMO shift, leading to a segmental GZE in non-highly myopic eyes, followed by a circular GZE in highly myopic eyes. Large gamma zone might be protective against macular Bruch's membrane defects.\n",

      " CHARACTERISTICS AND MANAGEMENT OF MYOPIC TRACTION MACULOPATHY IN MYOPIC EYES WITH AXIAL LENGTH LESS THAN 26.5 mm.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To explore the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) with axial length less than 26.5 mm and to assess the effectiveness of macular buckling for the treatment of MTM.\n",
      "METHODS: Thirty-eight MTM eyes with axial length less than 26.5 mm were prospectively enrolled. Thirty-one eyes received surgery, and they were followed up for at least 6 months. Characteristics of MTM and surgical outcomes were evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the MTM eyes, 92.11% (35/38) showed posterior staphyloma. Narrow macular staphyloma was the most common type (54.29%, 19/35), followed by peripapillary (37.14%, 13/35). Three cases (8.57%) had wide macular staphyloma, and 44.74% of cases (17/38) had vitreoretinal traction. Twenty-two MTM eyes of type T3 underwent macular buckling surgery, and all the cases achieved foveal reattachment after the surgery. The mean best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly at the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.001). Nine MTM eyes of type T4 or T5 received combined surgery, all macular holes recovered, and the best-corrected visual acuity also improved postoperatively (P = 0.008) as of the 6-month visit.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Posterior staphyloma might serve as the initial force of the pathogenesis of MTM in eyes with axial length ˂26.5 mm. Macular buckling is a productive way to improve the MTM.\n"

      " MACULAR SENSITIVITY AND CAPILLARY PERFUSION IN HIGHLY MYOPIC EYES WITH MYOPIC MACULAR DEGENERATION.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the interrelationship between macular sensitivity and retinal perfusion density (PD) in eyes with myopic macular degeneration (MMD).\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight highly myopic eyes from 82 adult participants were recruited. Macular sensitivity was evaluated using the Microperimeter MP-3. Retinal PD was measured using the PLEX Elite 9000 swept source optical coherence tomography angiography. Macular sensitivity values between different categories of MMD and its relationship with optical coherence tomography angiography measurements were evaluated using multivariable linear mixed models, adjusting for age and axial length.\n",
      "RESULTS: Macular sensitivity reduced with increasing severity of MMD (β ≤ -0.95, P < 0.001), whereas the best-corrected visual acuity was not associated with MMD severity (P > 0.04). Persons who were older (β = -0.08, P < 0.001), with longer axial length (β = -0.32, P = 0.005), presence of macular diffuse choroidal atrophy (β = -2.16, P < 0.001) or worse MMD (β = -5.70, P < 0.001), and presence of macular posterior staphyloma (β ≤ -2.98, P < 0.001) or Fuchs spot (β = -1.58, P = 0.04) were associated with reduced macular sensitivity. Macular sensitivity was significantly associated with deep retinal PD in MMD (β = 0.15, P = 0.004) but not with superficial retinal PD (P = 0.62).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: There was a strong correlation between reduced macular sensitivity and increasing MMD severity, even in mild MMD independent of the best-corrected visual acuity. Furthermore, macular sensitivity was correlated with deep retinal PD, suggesting a vasculature-function relationship in MMD.\n"

      " Prevalence and related factors of myopic retinopathy - a hospital-based cross-section study in Vietnam.\n",
      "CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Myopia prevention and anti-myopia treatment is of great importance in South East Asia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prevalence and related factors of myopic retinopathy in Vietnam.\n",
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 168 eyes of 88 patients with high myopia presenting to the Refraction Department of Vietnam National Eye Hospital. Inclusion criteria were high myopia (≤-6.00D with cycloplegic retinoscopy). Consecutive presenting patients recruited between January 2020 and August 2020 consented to participate.\n",
      "RESULTS: Participant age range was 12-47 years. Peripapillary atrophy was present in 70.2% of participants, most commonly atrophy of one-quarter of the disc (38.7%). Central retinal changes were present in 66.1% of participants, subclassified as tessellated fundus in 60.7%, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy in 4.2% and patchy chorioretinal atrophy in 1.2%. Peripheral retinal lesions were present in 43.5% of participants, consisting of white-without-pressure in 32.1%, lattice degeneration in 16.1%, snail track degeneration in 4.2% and microcystoid degeneration in 1.2%. Myopia ≤-8.00D and axial length ≥26.5 mm were associated with additional risk of posterior ocular complications. Furthermore, age ≥19 years increased risk of central myopic retinopathy and ≥10 years since initial myopia diagnosis increased the risk of peripapillary atrophy and central retinal changes. Other factors such as the age of onset of myopia and family myopia history did not appear to alter the risk of peripheral retina damage.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Retinal disorders were common in Vietnamese people with high myopia. Within the current cohort with high myopia, myopia ≤-8.00D and axial length ≥26.5 mm were associated with a significant further elevation of risk.\n"

      "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the choroidal and photoreceptor thickness in highly myopic eyes and its correlation with visual acuity.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, observational study involving 57 eyes of 57 highly myopic subjects [spherical equivalent ≥ -6 diopters (D) or axial length ≥ 26 mm] seen in a tertiary institutional center. Eyes with any clinical evidence of maculopathy or amblyopia were excluded. All subjects underwent a refraction assessment, visual acuity, axial length measurement using the IOL Master, and full ocular assessment. Eyes were imaged using Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography by one experienced operator. Two independent investigators manually measured subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and foveal photoreceptor thickness (FPT).\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean SFCT was 195.88 ± 87.63 μm (range: 32-373) and mean FPT was 96.68 ± 11.23 μm (range: 67-100), after correction for ocular magnification. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in LogMAR was negatively correlated with SFCT (\n",

      "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore whether there are interactions between genetic (ARMS2/HTRA1) and environmental factors (cigarette smoking) in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n",
      "METHODS: Primary human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells were obtained from four donors' eyes with AMD high-risk ARMS2/HTRA1 alleles, and two donors' eyes with wild-type alleles were used as controls. The pooled serum from 32 smokers and 35 nonsmokers were collected and used separately to treat hRPE cells. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics was used to identify associated proteins and comparing the differences between AMD high-risk and low-risk HTRA1/ARMS2 alleles after exposure to smokers' serum.\n",
      "RESULTS: After stimulation with the smokers' serum, 400 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected in the high-risk allele cells. Several DEPs are involved in neuronal protein degeneration and oxidative stress pathways. The smokers' serum stimulation or HTRA1 overexpression can both upregulate caveolin-1, which was one of the DEPs. Besides, the smokers' serum enhanced the phagocytosis of cultured human RPE cells.\n",

The quadrantal distribution characteristics of three-dimensional CVI indicate the subfovea and the nasal quadrant to be the essential quadrants for monitoring the choroidal vasculature alteration in the progression of myopia. The novel quantitative analyses of the choroidal vasculature by three-dimensional CVI may help to characterize the underlying pathophysiology of nonpathological high myopia.\n",

      " PREDICTORS OF RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM TEAR DEVELOPMENT AFTER TREATMENT FOR NEOVASCULAR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION USING SWEPT SOURCE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictors of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tear development after treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration using swept source optical coherence tomography angiography.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective study included 152 treatment-naïve eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration without high myopia that were followed up for 1 year after treatment. Eligible eyes were classified into eyes with or without RPE tear development. They were matched in a 1:2 ratio. The areas of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and RPE detachment (pigment epithelial detachment [PED]) were measured from optical coherence tomography angiography and OCT en face images, respectively. The optical coherence tomography angiography-specific parameters representing CNV status were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eight (5.3%) of the 152 eyes developed RPE tears (RPE tear group). After matching, 16 eyes without RPE tears were analyzed (non-RPE tear group). The ratio of the CNV/PED area was lower in the RPE tear group than that in the non-RPE tear group (P = 0.007). The PED area was broader (P = 0.008), and PED height was greater in the RPE tear group (P = 0.04). Optical coherence tomography angiography-specific parameters did not differ between the two groups.\n",

      " Effect of Different Preoperative Intraocular Pressures on the Prognosis of Traumatic Cyclodialysis Cleft Associated with Lens Subluxation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognosis of patients with blunt trauma-mediated cyclodialysis cleft and lens subluxation treated by dual capsular tension rings (CTRs) with different preoperative intraocular pressures (IOPs).\n",
      "METHODS: Twenty-five patients with cyclodialysis cleft and lens subluxation after blunt trauma were recruited in this study. They were categorized into the low IOP group (IOP < 10 mmHg) and normal IOP group (between 10 mm and 21 mmHg). A modified CTR (MCTR) or CTR was sutured into the ciliary sulcus, and another MCTR or CTR was implanted in the capsular bag. The prognosis outcome measurements, including BCVA (LogMAR), IOP, UBM, and macular character on OCT, were collected during the regular outpatient follow-up after surgery until the recovery of cyclodialysis cleft was found. Measures of cyclodialysis cleft recovery included successful IOP control (defined as an IOP within 10-21 mmHg), confirmation of cleft closure on UBM, and confirmation of IOL centration under slit-lamp examination. Follow-up period or recovery time was regarded as the duration between discharge from the hospital after the operation and the recovery of cyclodialysis cleft. The longest follow-up period was 1 year.\n",
      "RESULTS: Cyclodialysis cleft was successfully treated in 21/25 eyes, whereas lens subluxation was treated effectively in all 25 eyes. CTRs and IOLs were stable in all eyes. BCVA (P < 0.001) and IOP (P < 0.001) were significantly improved after surgery. The primary surgical complication included reversible IOP spike in seven eyes. Postoperative BCVA was found to have correlation with the preoperative IOP (P = 0.016), maculopathy (P = 0.002,), and trauma duration (P = 0.046). Worse BCVA (P = 0.037) and more severe grade of maculopathy (P = 0.030) were observed in the low IOP group (14 eyes). In contrast, a better prognosis and greater probability of IOP spike (P = 0.021) were observed in the normal IOP group (11 eyes).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Timely and proper intervention for traumatic cyclodialysis cleft associated with lens subluxation is essential. Lower preoperative IOP is associated with worse prognosis and prolonged recovery time, while caution should be taken in IOP spike monitoring in patients with normal preoperative IOP.\n",

      " A mysterious myopic surprise.\n",
      "A 73-year-old man with an ocular history of inactive age-related macular degeneration and chronic angle-closure glaucoma (CACG) in both eyes recently underwent femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery/phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation with simultaneous Hydrus microstent (Ivantis, Inc.) implantation in the left eye. Although there was some reported subincisional iris prolapse due to intraoperative floppy iris, the case was otherwise uneventful according to the referring surgeon. Two months postoperatively, he was referred to our office for a myopic surprise of approximately 2.0 diopters (D) in the left eye (Figure 1JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202202000-00022/figure1/v/2022-01-26T192641Z/r/image-tiff). Of note, he has a distant history of acute ACG and complicated cataract surgery in the right eye with a failed trabeculectomy. He subsequently had laser peripheral iridoplasty to pull the iris away from the angle in the right eye (Figure 2JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202202000-00022/figure2/v/2022-01-26T192641Z/r/image-tiff). His topical intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications at presentation included dorzolamide-timolol 1 drop twice daily in the left eye and 1 drop of timolol in the right eye once daily. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, and his oral medications include Tamsulosin (Flomax), Irbasartan (Avapro), and Atenolol. On examination, he had an UCDVA of 20/20 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye, and a BCDVA of 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. His manifest refraction was plano in the right eye and 1.50 -0.75 × 90 in the left eye. IOP measured 19 mm Hg in the right eye and 26 mm Hg in the left eye. Pupil examination revealed a nonreactive pupil in the right eye and a round sluggish pupil in the left eye without an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full in both eyes. On slitlamp examination, pertinent findings included the following: 1+ corneal guttata without edema in both eyes; anterior chambers were shallow but adequate in both eyes with scattered peripheral anterior synechiae in the right eye and a uniformly shallow but adequate chamber in the left eye; there was no cell or flare in either eye. Iris findings included a surgical pupil with a fibrotic pupillary membrane, laser iridoplasty scars with scattered temporal transillumination defects (TIDs) in the right eye, and 2.5 clock hours of TIDs and a patent peripheral iridotomy at 1 o'clock in the left eye; lens examination revealed centered posterior chamber IOLs with open posterior capsules in both eyes and lens pitting in the left eye. Pertinent findings on dilated fundus examination included a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 in both eyes with good neuroretinal rims and macular examination revealed medium-sized drusen with pigment clumping in both eyes and no active choroidal neovascular membranes. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. What is the etiology of this myopic surprise? What diagnostic testing will help confirm the diagnosis and what are the best management options for this patient?\n"

      "Describe drug utilisation and clinical outcomes of intravitreal anti-VEGF drug and dexamethasone use in the real-world setting in Southern Italy using data from multi-centre study of retinal disease. Clinical data of retinal disease patients treated with anti-VEGF drugs and dexamethasone implant in 6 out-patient ophthalmology centres from Southern Italy were collected by means of an electronic case report form. Patients receiving at least one intravitreal injection/implant of the study drugs were followed for up to two years and described in terms of demographics and clinical characteristics. Drug utilisation patterns were described. A sign-rank test was used to compare clinical data on visual acuity and other ophthalmic parameters from baseline at different follow-up times for each indication. Data from 1327 patients was collected. Most patients were diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (660, 49.7%), followed by diabetic macular oedema (423, 31.9%), retinal vein occlusion (164, 12.3%), and myopic choroidal neovascularization (80, 6.0%). Patients were followed for a median of 10.3 months (interquartile range: 3.6 - 24.7 months). Mean patient age was 69.7 (±10.9) years and 54.2% were males. Ranibizumab (55.4%) and aflibercept (27.5%) were the most commonly used drugs. Baseline visual acuity significantly improved by about 0.05 to 0.1 logMAR at all follow-up times for AMD and RVO but less consistently for the other diseases. Intravitreal ranibizumab use accounted for half of all treatment for retinal diseases in a Southern Italian out-patient setting. Patients treated with anti-VEGF drugs for AMD and RVO in Southern Italy experienced significant improvement in VA.\n"

      " Factors Associated with Macular Staphyloma Area on Ultra-widefield Fundus Images.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of applying ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images for macular staphyloma area (MSA) measurement and investigate the associated factors with MSA.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a retrospective study. MSA was measured by UWF imaging. Central foveal thickness, subfoveal choroidal thickness, subfoveal scleral thickness were measured on spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Intraclass correlation coefficients of MSA measurement would be evaluated. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the associated factors with MSA.\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, 135 eyes of 92 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 64.73 ± 10.84 years. Mean MSA on UWF image was 279.67 ± 71.70 mm2. Intraclass correlation coefficients of MSA measurement was 0.965 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.946 to 0.977; p < 0.001). In the multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for subfoveal choroidal thickness, best-corrected visual acuity, central foveal thickness, and subfoveal scleral thickness, the factors independently related to MSA were axial length (β = 8.352; 95% CI, 3.306 to 13.398; p = 0.001), sex (β = -26.673; 95% CI, -51.759 to -1.586; p = 0.037), age (β = 1.184; 95% CI, 0.020 to 2.348; p = 0.046).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to measure MSA on UWF image. Female, longer axial length, and older age may indicate larger MSA.\n"

      " Whole exome sequence analysis in 51 624 participants identifies novel genes and variants associated with refractive error and myopia.\n",
      "Refractive errors are associated with a range of pathological conditions, such as myopic maculopathy and glaucoma, and are highly heritable. Studies of missense and putative loss of function (pLOF) variants identified via whole exome sequencing (WES) offer the prospect of directly implicating potentially causative disease genes. We performed a genome-wide association study for refractive error in 51 624 unrelated adults, of European ancestry, aged 40-69 years from the UK and genotyped using WES. After testing 29 179 pLOF and 495 263 missense variants, 1 pLOF and 18 missense variants in 14 distinct genomic regions were taken forward for fine-mapping analysis. This yielded 19 putative causal variants of which 18 had a posterior inclusion probability >0.5. Of the 19 putative causal variants, 12 were novel discoveries. Specific variants were associated with a more myopic refractive error, while others were associated with a more hyperopic refractive error. Association with age of onset of spectacle wear (AOSW) was examined in an independent validation sample (38 100 early AOSW cases and 74 243 controls). Of 11 novel variants that could be tested, 8 (73%) showed evidence of association with AOSW status. This work identified COL4A4 and ATM as novel candidate genes associated with refractive error. In addition, novel putative causal variants were identified in the genes RASGEF1, ARMS2, BMP4, SIX6, GSDMA, GNGT2, ZNF652 and CRX. Despite these successes, the study also highlighted the limitations of community-based WES studies compared with high myopia case-control WES studies.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the choroidal vascularity index (CVI) in patients affected by leptochoroid.\n",
      "METHODS: Three distinct age-matched cohorts were collected: patients with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) secondary to age-related macular degeneration, patients with high-myopia, and healthy controls. CVI was calculated in the subfoveal 6000 μm diameter area.\n",
      "RESULTS: 54 eyes (54 patients) were included (18 eyes in each cohort). No statistical differences were disclosed in terms of age between controls, RPD patients (p = 0.062), and myopic patients (p = 0.070). Total choroidal area showed a different distribution among the 3 cohorts (p < 0.001), due to the reduction of luminal and stromal choroidal area in both RPD and myopic groups in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). Interestingly, CVI showed a different distribution between the 3 cohorts (p < 0.001). In detail, RPD group showed no changes in CVI in comparison to controls (p = 1.000), whereas the myopic group showed a higher CVI in comparison to both RPD group and controls (p < 0.001 in both analyses).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Different changes of the choroidal vascular and stromal components characterize the leptochoroid secondary to RPD eyes and high-myopic eyes. The relative greater impairment of the vascular area in RPD eyes in comparison to myopic eyes could be at the basis of the lower development of RPD in patients with high myopia.\n"

      " Light and myopia: from epidemiological studies to neurobiological mechanisms.\n",
      "Myopia is far beyond its inconvenience and represents a true, highly prevalent, sight-threatening ocular condition, especially in Asia. Without adequate interventions, the current epidemic of myopia is projected to affect 50% of the world population by 2050, becoming the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Although blurred vision, the predominant symptom of myopia, can be improved by contact lenses, glasses or refractive surgery, corrected myopia, particularly high myopia, still carries the risk of secondary blinding complications such as glaucoma, myopic maculopathy and retinal detachment, prompting the need for prevention. Epidemiological studies have reported an association between outdoor time and myopia prevention in children. The protective effect of time spent outdoors could be due to the unique characteristics (intensity, spectral distribution, temporal pattern, etc.) of sunlight that are lacking in artificial lighting. Concomitantly, studies in animal models have highlighted the efficacy of light and its components in delaying or even stopping the development of myopia and endeavoured to elucidate possible mechanisms involved in this process. In this narrative review, we (1) summarize the current knowledge concerning light modulation of ocular growth and refractive error development based on studies in human and animal models, (2) summarize potential neurobiological mechanisms involved in the effects of light on ocular growth and emmetropization and (3) highlight a potential pathway for the translational development of noninvasive light-therapy strategies for myopia prevention in children.\n",

      "DESIGN: The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is a population-based cohort study including 15 010 participants aged 35 to 74 years at baseline.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 494 eyes of 323 participants (mean age, 50.2 ± 9.2 years; median, -7.25 diopters [D] myopic refractive error) without myopic maculopathy at baseline and 34 eyes of 27 subjects (mean age, 56.7 ± 9.1 years; median, -8.75 D myopic refractive error) with myopic maculopathy met the inclusion conditions, phakic eyes with spherical equivalent ≤-6 D (baseline), and had gradable fundus photographs at baseline and 5-year follow-up.\n",

      "RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative incidence of myopic maculopathy was 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-1.99; n = 1). Progression occurred in 17 of 34 eyes (50%) with prior myopic maculopathy over 5 years with 4 changes in category. The most common types of progression were enlargement of diffuse and patchy chorioretinal atrophy; a new pathology was present in 8 eyes. Higher intraocular pressure (IOP) (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.51-1.59; P = 0.035) was associated with progression of myopic maculopathy.

      " Decreasing myopic lacquer crack and widening parapapillary gamma zone: case report.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopic axial elongation may be due to an equatorial enlargement of Bruch's membrane (BM), leading to a prolate eye shape and increasing strain with BM and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer at the posterior pole. The increased BM strain may cause an enlargement of Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) of the optic nerve head, with the subsequent development and enlargement of parapapillary gamma zone as BM-free parapapillary zone. The increased strain within BM and RPE may also cause lacquer cracks (LCs) as linear breaks in the RPE and / or BM. Studies suggested that a more marked gamma zone enlargement is associated with lower prevalence of LCs or macular BM defects. Here report on the disappearance of a LC during a 10-year follow-up of a highly myopic eye, concurrent with a marked increase in gamma zone.\n",
      "CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman showed in her right eye (axial length measured 30.69 mm) a LC, vertically oval optic disc, and parapapillary gamma zone in 2001. When re-examined in 2006, gamma zone had enlarged, while the LC was no longer detectable. In 2011, the LC was not visible neither upon ophthalmoscopy and or upon optical coherence tomography (OCT), while gamma zone had further enlarged. The gamma zone enlargement occurred in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the former LC.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The observation suggest that a LC can decrease in width, in temporal association with an enlargement of gamma zone. It fits with the notion that an enlargement of the BMO (i.e., enlarging gamma zone) may lead to a relaxation of the BM strain and subsequently to a decrease in the width of the LC.\n"

      " An Effective and Robust Approach Based on R-CNN+LSTM Model and NCAR Feature Selection for Ophthalmological Disease Detection from Fundus Images.\n",
      "Changes in and around anatomical structures such as blood vessels, optic disc, fovea, and macula can lead to ophthalmological diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), myopia, hypertension, and cataracts. If these diseases are not diagnosed early, they may cause partial or complete loss of vision in patients. Fundus imaging is the primary method used to diagnose ophthalmologic diseases. In this study, a powerful R-CNN+LSTM-based approach is proposed that automatically detects eight different ophthalmologic diseases from fundus images. Deep features were extracted from fundus images with the proposed R-CNN+LSTM structure. Among the deep features extracted, those with high representative power were selected with an approach called NCAR, which is a multilevel feature selection algorithm. In the classification phase, the SVM algorithm, which is a powerful classifier, was used. The proposed approach is evaluated on the eight-class ODIR dataset. The accuracy (main metric), sensitivity, specificity, and precision metrics were used for the performance evaluation of the proposed approach. Besides, the performance of the proposed approach was compared with the existing approaches using the ODIR dataset.\n",

      " Outcomes of macular buckling with a T-shaped buckle for myopic tractional maculopathies associated with posterior staphyloma: An Indian experience.\n",
      "PURPOSE: : To report the anatomic and visual outcomes following macular buckling in patients affected by pathological myopia-associated foveoschisis (FS) and macular detachment with or without macular hole (MH).\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective interventional consecutive case series wherein 25 highly myopic eyes (mean axial length 28.46 mm; range, 25-33.8 mm) of 24 patients (16 females and 8 males; mean age 54.1 years; range, 35-74 years) presenting with macular detachment associated with a posterior staphyloma (PS), who underwent macular buckling, were evaluated. Patients with absence or reduction in subretinal fluid by more than 90% during the final follow-up along with inversion of contour of staphyloma were considered to have a successful anatomical outcome and those with improvement or maintenance in visual acuity were considered to have a successful functional outcome. The mean duration of follow-up was 11.2 months.\n",
      "RESULTS: At the time of initial presentation, the mean age of the 24 patients was 54.1 ± 10.28 years. Macular detachment along with FS was present in all cases, whereas full-thickness macular hole-related retinal detachment was present in nine cases. Swept-source optical coherence tomography parameters showed reduction of FS with foveal reattachment in all eyes except one at last visit. Mean axial length decreased from 28.5 mm preoperatively (range 26-33.8 mm) to 26.2 mm (range 24-29.3 mm). The mean best-corrected visual acuity changed from 1.16 log MAR to 1.096 Log MAR (P = 0.165). Visual acuity improved in 10 eyes (40%), remained stable in 11 eyes (44%) and decreased in 4 eyes (16%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Macular buckling is a good surgical technique with encouraging anatomic and visual outcomes in patients with myopic macular detachment associated with PS. Highly selective cases of myopic traction maculopathy can have a viable option of macular buckle surgery in stabilizing the retinal tractional changes, and thereby, vision loss.\n"

      "PURPOSE: It is common for physicians to be uncertain when examining some images. Models trained with human uncertainty could be a help for physicians in diagnosing pathologic myopia.\n",
      "DESIGN: This is a hospital-based study that included 9176 images from 1327 patients that were collected between October 2015 and March 2019.\n",
      "METHODS: All collected images were graded by 21 myopia specialists according to the presence of myopic neovascularization (MNV), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), and dome-shaped macula (DSM). Hard labels were made by the rule of major wins, while soft labels were possibilities calculated by whole grading results from the different graders. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics curve, the area under precision-recall (AUPR) curve, F-score, and least square errors were used to evaluate the performance of the models.\n",
      "RESULTS: The AUC values of models trained by soft labels in MNV, MTM, and DSM models were 0.985, 0.946, and 0.978; and the AUPR values were 0.908, 0.876, and 0.653 respectively. However, 0.56% of MNV \"negative\" cases were answered as \"positive\" with high certainty by the hard label model, whereas no case was graded with extreme errors by the soft label model. The same results were found for the MTM (0.95% vs none) and DSM (0.43% vs 0.09%) models.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The predicted possibilities from the models trained by soft labels were close to the results made by myopia specialists. These findings could inspire the novel use of deep learning models in the medical field.\n"

      " Four-year follow up of macular intrachoroidal cavitation and chorioretinal atrophy: A case report.\n",
      "RATIONALE: Macular intrachoroidal cavitation (ICC) is characterized by presence of a hyporeflective space beneath the unaltered retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is noted around the region of focal chorioretinal atrophy in eyes with pathologic myopia. The findings suggest that the patchy chorioretinal atrophy (PCA) progresses to ICC with time. However, there have been no reports describing long-term observational studies using OCT. We collected a case of PCA progression to macular ICC using OCT during a 4-year follow-up.\n",
      "PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old woman presented with metamorphopsia and blurred vision in her left eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 and spherical equivalent refraction was -14.0 diopters in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed a white, well-defined PCA at the superonasal to the fovea which showed hypofluorescence determined by autofluorescence in the left eye. Sclera curved posteriorly at the superonasal to the fovea and the choroid was thickened at the area and ellipsoid zone (EZ) was disrupted in the area in OCT images. Additionally, another OCT images through the PCA showed a disappearance of the RPE-Bruch's membrane complex and a connection of blood vessels running from the sclera to the choroid.\n",
      "DIAGNOSES: PCA with macular ICC.\n",
      "INTERVENTIONS: Observation.\n",
      "OUTCOMES: During 4-year follow up, the white patchy lesion and the hypofluorescence region gradually expanded. BCVA decreased with the expansion of the lesion and was 20/100 at the final visit. OCT through the fovea showed that the disorganized EZ expanded toward the ICC and the sensory retina of the fovea became thinner. Moreover, RPE-Bruch's membrane complex was not observed 3 years after the initial visit. During the follow-up period, the sensory retina was prominently displaced posteriorly to the ICC, though no obvious change was observed in the structure of the sclera.\n",
      "LESSONS: In cases of PCA with macular ICC, the outer retina and RPE may initially atrophy, showing as an expansion of PCA, because the attachment between the inner retina and sclera may be weakened. This may result in the displacement of the retinal tissue into the space of macular ICC.\n",

Choroidal neovascularization or Fuchs spot was present in 2.7% (n = 17), both lesions in 0.3% (n = 2), and lacquer cracks in 1.4% (n = 9). Staphyloma, PPA, and MMD were highly prevalent in visual impaired and blind eyes (frequency was 73.9% [20 of 27], 90.5% [19 of 21], and 63.0% [17 of 27] of unilateral blind eyes for MMD, staphyloma, and PPA, respectively). Seven previous studies in Asian populations reported a variable MMD frequency ranging from 8.3% to 64%, but frequencies were similar for comparable risk profiles based on age and SER.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of a highly myopic Dutch population of European ancestry, myopic retinal features were frequent; were associated with age, SER, and AL; and occurred in all visually severely impaired eyes. The absence of treatment options for most of these retinal complications emphasizes the need for effective strategies to prevent high myopia.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) through inter-eye comparisons of asymmetric ocular features in patients with unilateral MTM.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHOD: Highly myopic patients with unilateral MTM were enrolled in the study. The results of comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations, color fundus images, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were reviewed. MTM and myopic atrophic maculopathy was evaluated according to the ATN classification system. The status of the posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), posterior precortical vitreous pocket, vitreoretinal interface abnormalities, posterior staphyloma height (PSH), and the location of the protrusion of the sclera were assessed through OCT.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 54 eyes of 27 patients 48.89 ± 12.78 years of age, the affected eyes had worse best-corrected visual acuity, a longer axial length (AXL), greater PSH, and higher rates of posterior staphylomas, vitreovascular traction and epiretinal membranes (ERMs) than the fellow eyes (\n",

      " Retinal Diseases Regulated by Hypoxia-Basic and Clinical Perspectives: A Comprehensive Review.\n",
      "In recent years, the number of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is increasing worldwide along with increased life expectancy. Currently, the standard treatment for wet-AMD is intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs. The upstream of VEGF is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a master regulator of hypoxia-responsive genes responsive to acute and chronic hypoxia. HIF activation induces various pathological pro-angiogenic gene expressions including VEGF under retinal hypoxia, ultimately leading to the development of ocular ischemic neovascular diseases. In this regard, HIF is considered as a promising therapeutic target in ocular ischemic diseases. In clinical ophthalmology, abnormal hypofluorescent areas have been detected in the late-phase of indocyanine green angiography, which are thought to be lipid deposits at the level of Bruch's membrane to choriocapillaris in vitreoretinal diseases. These deposits may interfere with the oxygen and nutrients that should be supplied to the retinal pigment epithelium, and that HIF/VEGF is highly suspected to be expressed in the hypoxic retinal pigment epithelium, leading to neovascularization. In this review, we comprehensively summarize pathophysiology of AMD-related ocular diseases with the HIF/VEGF pathway from basic and clinic researches with recent findings.\n"

      " Prediction of Different Eye Diseases Based on Fundus Photography via Deep Transfer Learning.\n",
      "With recent advancements in machine learning, especially in deep learning, the prediction of eye diseases based on fundus photography using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) has attracted great attention. However, studies focusing on identifying the right disease among several candidates, which is a better approximation of clinical diagnosis in practice comparing with the case that aims to distinguish one particular eye disease from normal controls, are limited. The performance of existing algorithms for multi-class classification of fundus images is at most mediocre. Moreover, in many studies consisting of different eye diseases, labeled images are quite limited mainly due to privacy concern of patients. In this case, it is infeasible to train huge DCNNs, which usually have millions of parameters. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize a lightweight deep learning architecture called MobileNetV2 and transfer learning to distinguish four common eye diseases, including Glaucoma, Maculopathy, Pathological Myopia, and Retinitis Pigmentosa, from normal controls using a small training data. We also apply a visualization approach to highlight the loci that are most related to the disease labels to make the model more explainable. The highlighted area chosen by the algorithm itself may give some hints for further fundus image studies. Our experimental results show that our system achieves an average accuracy of 96.2%, sensitivity of 90.4%, and specificity of 97.6% on the test data via five independent runs, and outperforms two other deep learning-based algorithms both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n",

      " Progression Patterns of Myopic Traction Maculopathy in the Fellow Eye After Pars Plana Vitrectomy of the Primary Eye.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This retrospective study investigated the patterns and risk factors of progression of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) of fellow eyes after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) of primary eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: The study population comprised 153 patients with MTM in both myopic eyes who sequentially underwent PPV (2006-2021). Observation periods were from PPV of the primary eye (baseline) to PPV of the fellow (end). MTM was graded based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and the ATN (atrophy [A], traction [T], and neovascularization [N]) system. An increase in T grade was considered MTM progression.\n",
      "RESULTS: MTM progressed in 43.8% of fellow eyes during 34.57 ± 34.08 months. The progression of fellow eyes correlated with T grade of primary eyes (P < 0.001). Risk factors for the progression of MTM in fellow eyes were primary eyes in T4-T5, age at baseline <60 years, and fellow eyes with partial posterior vitreous detachment (PVD; P < 0.001, P = 0.042, and P = 0.002, respectively). Fellow eyes in T1/T2 at baseline progressed faster compared with those in T0 (P < 0.001); the annual rate of progression to T3-T5 of the T0 (T1-T2) groups was 9.98% (24.59%).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for the progression of MTM in fellow eyes included PPV when relatively young, primary eye at high T grade, and partial PVD of the fellow eye. Personalized follow-up for fellow eyes should be based on the severity of MTM of both eyes.\n"

      "Objective To study the long-term changes of the morphological parameters of the posterior pole in highly myopic patients over 40 years old in Chinese natural population. Methods A population-based follow-up study. The study included 71 patients (27 males, 44 females; 110 eyes) with high myopia who completed the Beijing Eye Study in 2001 and 2011 and had assessable color fundus photographs. The age of the patients in 2011 was 56.2±9.5 years old. According to the definition of pathological myopia by the meta-analysis of the Pathological Myopia Research Group, the fundus photos in 2001 were interpreted, and 110 eyes were divided into groups of simple high myopia (79 eyes) and pathological myopia (31 eyes). The morphological parameters during the 2 follow-up visits in 2001 and 2011 were measured in the color fundus photos, including optic disc tilt ratio, optic disc rotation degree, β zone area, disc-fovea distance, disc-outer β zone border distance, fovea-outer β zone border distance, and vertical distance between temporal arterial arcades, and compared in all the subjects, patients with simple high myopia and patients with pathological myopia. Correlations between the 10-year changes of these parameters and other parameters were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. Results In all subjects, the incidence of optic disc tilt and rotation was 41.1% (44/107) and 63.3% (68/107), respectively. The optic disc tilt ratio in 2001 and 2011 was 1.34±0.31 and 1.34±0.33, respectively. The optic disc rotation degree was 30.4±26.3° and 30.0±25.3 in 2001 and 2011, respectively.

      " Advances in biomedical study of the myopia-related signaling pathways and mechanisms.\n",
      "Myopia has become one of the most critical health problems in the world with the increasing time spent indoors and increasing close work. Pathological myopia may have multiple complications, such as myopic macular degeneration, retinal detachment, cataracts, open-angle glaucoma, and severe cases that can cause blindness. Mounting evidence suggests that the cause of myopia can be attributed to the complex interaction of environmental exposure and genetic susceptibility. An increasing number of researchers have focused on the genetic pathogenesis of myopia in recent years. Scleral remodeling and excessive axial elongating induced retina thinning and even retinal detachment are myopia's most important pathological manifestations. The related signaling pathways are indispensable in myopia occurrence and development, such as dopamine, nitric oxide, TGF-β, HIF-1α, etc. We review the current major and recent progress of biomedicine on myopia-related signaling pathways and mechanisms.\n",

      " Efficacy of Large Optic Intraocular Lenses in Myopic Eyes with Posterior Segment Pathology.\n",
      "We report a case series of patients with high myopia (axial length 25.04-27.59 mm) diagnosed with cataract and maculopathy who underwent a combined procedure of phacoemulsification with implantation of a large optic intraocular lens (IOL) and intravitreal injection. Six patients with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 73.20 ± 7.19 years received the 7.0-mm optic ASPIRA-aXA IOL (HumanOptics AG, Erlangen, Germany) and intravitreal injection of aflibercept at the end of the surgery. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) improved significantly (p = 0.001) from a preoperative logMAR of 0.87 ± 0.28 logMAR to 0.49 ± 0.18 logMAR at 10 weeks postoperatively. Even though all patients had a persisting central scotoma due to their maculopathy, there was a significant improvement in their subjective quality of life and self-autonomy. Patients reported no postoperative dysphotopsia. During surgery and postoperative examinations, the wide IOL optic permitted an enhanced view of the fundus. The IOLs remained stable after implantation, especially during the intravitreal injection at the end of the surgery. No IOL displacement or shift of the lens was observed. Retinal diseases are sight-threatening and diminish the patient's quality of life due to reduced visual acuity and visual field defects. When cataract surgery is performed in this patient group, a reduced prognosis can be assumed. Our results show that implantation of the large optic IOL enables a wide view of the fundus during and after surgery without any additional risks or negative effects. It may also reduce the risk of dysphotopsia in cases of IOL decentration in large capsular bags, but comparative studies with a higher number of cases are needed to confirm this. A large rhexis and large IOL optic seem to be advantageous for the retinal surgeon in follow-up surgeries on the posterior segment of the eye.\n"

      "METHODS: Twenty-three eyes of 22 patients (69.7 ± 9.9 years old) who underwent vitrectomy with FSIP without gas tamponade for ERM foveoschisis were analyzed. All patients underwent follow-up examinations for at least 12 months. In the FSIP technique, the ILM is peeled off in a donut shape, preserving the foveal ILM. The logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), and surgical complications were examined.\n",
      "RESULTS: The BCVA at 12 months improved significantly from baseline (p < 0.001). Baseline ellipsoid zone defects were found in 2 eyes (9%), and all defective eyes had recovered at 12 months.

      "Parapapillary atrophy is one of the parameters of the optic nerve head area which are assessed during the ophthalmoscopic examination particularly useful to characterize glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Optical coherence tomography evaluation provides high-resolution images of the optic nerve head and surrounding area, and can be used to study parapapillary atrophy. Different parapapillary atrophy zones were described depending on their histological features and research has been conducted to investigate the possible association between the presence and/ or size of parapapillary atrophy zones and several optic nerve disorders. In this review we discuss the histology and the clinical findings related to parapapillary atrophy in patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy, non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies (e.g. arteritic and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathies; suprasellar and parasellar tumors), and other ocular conditions (e.g. high myopia; age-related macular degeneration). Two different histologic classifications were identified. Parapapillary atrophy was demonstrated in glaucoma and glaucoma-like neuropathies, but not in other types of optic nerve disorders.\n"

      " Histology of neovascular myopic macular degeneration.\n",
      "To assess the histological correlate of neovascular or exudative myopic macular degeneration (nMMD) in highly myopic human eyes, we examined histomorphometrically histologic sections of enucleated eyes of Caucasian patients. The study included 284 eyes (age: 61.9 ± 13.7 years; range: 24-89 years; axial length: 25.5 ± 3.1 mm; range: 20-37 mm). An nMMD was detected in 5 eyes (axial length: 29.6 ± 2.6 mm; range: 26.0-31.0 mm). All these eyes showed within or close to the nMMD a macular Bruch's membrane (BM) defect, fibrous tissue with erythrocyte-filled blood vessels, and proliferations of irregularly pigmented and irregularly piled-up retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells each of which was connected with a curled-up, PAS (Periodic-Acid-Shiff)-positive membrane. The nMMD lesions were covered by proliferated RPE cells. RPE cells were not detected within the retina. In binary regression analysis, a higher nMMD prevalence was associated with a higher prevalence of macular BM defects (odds ratio: > 1000; P < 0.001), while the association with axial length was not significant (P = 0.43) in that model. After adjustment for the presence of macular BM defects, the nMMD prevalence was not associated with BM thickness (measured at the posterior pole, equator-posterior pole midpoint, equator and shortly posterior to the ora serrata) (P = 0.10; P = 0.87; P = 0.40; and P = 0.36, respectively), RPE cell layer thickness (P = 0.83; P = 0.79; P = 0.31; P = 0.38, resp.), RPE cell density (P = 0.56; P = 0.91; P = 0.47; P = 0.87, resp.), choriocapillaris thickness (P = 0.47; P = 0.93; P = 0.41; P = 0.75, resp.), and choriocapillaris density (P = 0.99; P = 0.94; P = 0.17; P = 0.97, resp.). The results suggest that nMMD is characterized by a fibrous pseudo-metaplasia of the RPE and is strongly associated with macular BM defects, without other detected histomorphometric differences in thickness or density of the RPE, BM, and choriocapillaris.\n",

      " CD146 as a promising therapeutic target for retinal and choroidal neovascularization diseases.\n",
      "Blood vessel dysfunction causes several retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, macular degeneration and choroidal neovascularization in pathological myopia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-neutralizing proteins provide benefits in most of those diseases, yet unsolved haemorrhage and frequent intraocular injections still bothered patients. Here, we identified endothelial CD146 as a new target for retinal diseases. CD146 expression was activated in two ocular pathological angiogenesis models, a laser-induced choroid neovascularization model and an oxygen-induced retinopathy model. The absence of CD146 impaired hypoxia-induced cell migration and angiogenesis both in cell lines and animal model. Preventive or therapeutic treatment with anti-CD146 antibody AA98 significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced aberrant retinal angiogenesis in two retinal disease models. Mechanistically, under hypoxia condition, CD146 was involved in the activation of NFκB, Erk and Akt signalling pathways, which are partially independent of VEGF. Consistently, anti-CD146 therapy combined with anti-VEGF therapy showed enhanced impairment effect of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Given the critical role of abnormal angiogenesis in retinal and choroidal diseases, our results provide novel insights into combinatorial therapy for neovascular fundus diseases.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are among the leading causes of blindness in the United States and other developed countries. Early detection is the key to prevention and effective treatment. We have built an artificial intelligence-based screening system which utilizes a cloud-based platform for combined large scale screening through primary care settings for early diagnosis of these diseases.\n",
      "METHODS: iHealthScreen Inc., an independent medical software company, has developed automated AMD and DR screening systems utilizing a telemedicine platform based on deep machine learning techniques. For both diseases, we prospectively imaged both eyes of 340 unselected non-dilated subjects over 50 years of age. For DR specifically, 152 diabetic patients at New York Eye and Ear faculty retina practices, ophthalmic and primary care clinics in New York city with color fundus cameras. Following the initial review of the images, 308 images with other confounding conditions like high myopia and vascular occlusion, and poor quality were excluded, leaving 676 eligible images for AMD and DR evaluation. Three ophthalmologists evaluated each of the images, and after adjudication, the patients were determined referrable or non-referable for AMD DR. Concerning AMD, 172 were labeled referable (intermediate or late), and 504 were non-referable (no or early). Concurrently, regarding DR, 33 were referable (moderate or worse), and 643 were non-referable (none or mild). All images were uploaded to iHealthScreen's telemedicine platform and analyzed by the automated systems for both diseases. The system performances are tested on per eye basis with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa scores with respect to the professional graders.\n",
      "RESULTS: In identifying referable DR, the system achieved a sensitivity of 97.0% and a specificity of 96.3%, and a kappa score of 0.70 on this prospective dataset. For AMD, the sensitivity was 86.6%, the specificity of 92.1%, and a kappa score of 0.76.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The AMD and DR screening tools achieved excellent performance operating together to identify two retinal diseases prospectively in mixed datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of such tools in the early diagnosis of eye diseases.

      " Primary and secondary focal choroidal excavation morphologic phenotypes, associated ocular disorders and prognostic implications.\n",
      "AIMS: To characterise and classify the morphological, clinical and tomographic characteristics of focal choroidal excavation (FCE) lesions to determine their prognostic implications.\n",
      "METHODS: 36 eyes with FCE (32 patients) underwent multimodal imaging, including spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence. FCE lesions were classified into three subtypes: (1) type 1: myopic (central choroidal thickness: <100 µm), (2) type 2: suspected congenital (central choroidal thickness: 100-200 µm, without associated chorioretinal pathology) and (3) type 3: secondary or acquired (central choroidal thickness: >200 µm, with associated chorioretinal pathology).\n",
      "RESULTS: 80.6% of eyes were followed longitudinally (26.8±18.8 months). There were 9 type 1 FCEs (myopic), 8 type 2 FCEs (U-shaped, congenital) and 19 type 3 FCEs (V-shaped, secondary). Type 2 FCEs trended towards larger maximum widths (p=0.0563). Type 3 FCEs were associated with central serous chorioretinopathy or pachyvessels (47.4%), but were also seen in pattern dystrophy, geographic atrophy, inactive choroiditis, torpedo maculopathy and adult-onset vitelliform dystrophy. Choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVMs) were more prevalent in type 3 FCE (41.2% compared with 11.1% for type 1 FCE, p=0.251, and 0% for type 2 FCE, p=0.043).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The FCE types, stratified by central choroidal thickness, demonstrated distinct morphological characteristics and associated findings. The classification scheme held prognostic implications as type 3 FCE with V shapes were associated with other chorioretinal conditions and were more likely to develop CNVM.\n"

      " Analysis of visual disability in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pathologic myopia is the leading cause in working age.\n",
      "This study assessed the causes of visual impairment over a decade in Buenos Aires City. This is a retrospective case series where we reviewed the database of visual disability certificates issued by the Buenos Aires City Ministry of Health between 2009 and 2017. In Argentina, visual disability is defined as a visual acuity = 20/200 in the better eye, or a corresponding visual field of less than 20 degrees in the less impaired eye. The database included the following variables: year of issue, age, gender, and cause of visual disability. Between 2009 and 2017 a total of 7656 subjects were certified as legally blind. The mean age of the sample was 57 ± 21 years and 52.1% were females. The emission was near 700 certificates per year. The age distribution showed that 62.8% of certificates were from patients older than 50 years and that only 6.6% were given to subjects under 20. The leading causes of visual disability in Buenos Aires City were age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with a rate of 15.5%, degenerative myopia (14.4%), primary open-angle glaucoma (11.3%) and diabetic retinopathy (6.6%). In subjects younger than 50, degenerative myopia was the first cause of visual disability. Interestingly in Argentina, where the prevalence of myopia is low, degenerative myopia is found to be the major cause of visual disability in middle-aged adult subjects. Population and clinical methods to avoid this preventable disease should need to be implemented as a matter of urgency.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To characterize the multimodal retinal findings of myopic macular pits, a feature of myopic degeneration.\n",
      "METHODS: A case series of patients with myopic macular pits were studied with multimodal imaging including color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), near infrared reflectance (NIR), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICG).\n",
      "RESULTS: Nine eyes of 6 patients with myopic macular pit were examined. Four patients presented with multiple pits and 3 with bilateral involvement. All pits were localized in a region of severe macular chorioretinal atrophy associated with myopic posterior staphyloma. In 3 eyes, the entrance of the posterior ciliary artery through the sclera was noted at the base of the pit. Schisis overlying the pit or adjacent to the pit was identified in 3 patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Myopic macular pits are an additional rare sign of myopic degeneration, developing in regions of posterior staphyloma complicated by severe chorioretinal atrophy and thin sclera.\n"

      "PURPOSE: Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) is the leading cause of visual loss in high myopia. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and complete ILM peeling for MTM.\n",
      "METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed to find relevant studies. A meta-analysis was conducted by comparing the weighted mean differences (WMD) in the change of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT) from baseline and calculating the odd ratios (OR) for rates of complete reattachment (CR) and postoperative macular hole (MH) formation.\n",
      "RESULTS: Ten studies were selected, including 417 eyes (172 eyes in the fovea-sparing ILM peeling group (FSIP) and 245 eyes in complete ILM peeling group (CIP)). There was no significant difference in terms of mean change in CFT from baseline and the rate of CR(WMD = 3.53, 95% CI, -25.56 to 32.63, P = 0.81, and OR = 1.41, 95% CI, 0.81 to 2.44, P = 0.22). FSIP was superior to CIP in terms of mean change of logMAR BCVA post operation (WMD = -0.09, 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.03, P = 0.003), and associated with a significantly lower frequency of postoperative MH formation (OR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.50, P = 0.0008).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: FSIP resulted in similar anatomic outcomes compared to CIP, but resulted in better visual acuity and lower rates of postoperative MH development.\n"

      " 27-gauge sutureless vitrectomy under topical anesthesia: A pilot study.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The implementation of the 27-gauge (G) sutureless vitrectomy technique is associated with a marked shortening of surgery time, faster healing of scleral and conjunctival wounds, less severe conjunctival scarring, limited postoperative corneal astigmatism, and marked improvement in the postoperative comfort of patients. The traditional methods of anesthesia for vitrectomy surgery are quite varied and each has its own potential for complications.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and safety of 27G pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) performed under local topical anesthesia for diabetic maculopathy, asteroid hyalosis and vitreomacular traction syndrome associated with high myopia.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three carefully selected patients with various vitreoretinal disorders underwent primary 27G PPV performed by a single surgeon under local topical anesthesia. Patients were analyzed in regard to best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, intraoperative/postoperative complications, intraoperative/postoperative pain, and surgery time.\n",
      "RESULTS: All patients showed postoperative improvement in visual acuity. No decrease in intraocular pressure below 10 mm Hg was documented on postoperative day 1. Furthermore, no postoperative complications were recorded during the six-month follow-up, and evident improvement in the anatomical status was confirmed using ophthalmic coherence tomography in all cases.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the percentages and risk factors for visual impairment (VI) across age groups in a highly myopic cohort with a wide range of age (18-93 years).\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 2099 eyes (1220 participants) were enrolled. All participants underwent detailed ocular examinations. Myopic maculopathy (MM) was assessed as myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) or myopic neovascular maculopathy (MNM) based on the ATN system.\n",
      "RESULTS: Most participants younger than 50 years had normal vision, while the cumulative risk of VI and blindness gradually increased after 50-59 years. The percentage of each type of MM increased nonlinearly with ageing (all p < 0.001), with an accelerated period of increase after 45 years for MAM, and after 50 years for MTM and MNM. Axial length (AL) ≥30 mm was the only associated factor for mild VI or worse in participants aged 18-39 years (p < 0.001). Older age, AL ≥30 mm and the presence of MAM were predictors for mild VI or worse in the group aged 40-49 years (all p < 0.05). In participants aged ≥50 years, older age, female sex, longer AL and increased severity of MM were risk factors for VI and blindness (all p < 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The percentages of MM and related VI increased nonlinearly with older age, with a turning point at 45 years for MAM, preceding that of MTM, MNM and VI by 5 years, warranting future longitudinal studies to confirm. Different age groups presented different risk factors for VI. Timely screening should be in place for middle-aged high myopes.\n"

      "METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 113 MTM patients (113 eyes). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurements and optical coherence tomography findings were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 38.2 ± 11.1 months, 49 of 113 eyes (43.4 %) progressed. The progression rate of outer schisis prominently located in the fovea or posterior staphyloma was significantly higher than that of outer schisis prominently located in paravascular areas (P = 0.0011). MTM with partial posterior vitreous detachment during the follow-up progressed more rapidly than MTM without (P = 0.0447). Patients with older age (> 65 years), without domed-shaped macula and with defects in the ellipsoid zone (EZ) had worse BCVA at the last visit (P = 0.0416, P = 0.0494and P = 0.0130).

      " Framework for quantitative three-dimensional choroidal vasculature analysis using optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "Choroidal vasculature plays an important role in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases, such as myopic maculopathy, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, and ocular inflammatory diseases. Current optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology provides three-dimensional visualization of the choroidal angioarchitecture; however, quantitative measures remain challenging. Here, we propose and validate a framework to segment and quantify the choroidal vasculature from a prototype swept-source OCT (PLEX Elite 9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec, USA) using a 3×3 mm scan protocol centered on the macula. Enface images referenced from the retinal pigment epithelium were reconstructed from the volumetric data. The boundaries of the choroidal volume were automatically identified by tracking the choroidal vessel feature structure over the depth, and a selective sliding window was applied for segmenting the vessels adaptively from attenuation-corrected enface images. We achieved a segmentation accuracy of 96% ± 1% as compared with manual annotation, and a dice coefficient of 0.83 ± 0.04 for repeatability. Using this framework on both control (0.00 D to -2.00 D) and highly myopic (-8.00 D to -11.00 D) eyes, we report a decrease in choroidal vessel volume (p<0.001) in eyes with high myopia.\n"

      " Modern Imaging Techniques for Visualising Choroidal Morphology and Function.\n",
      "The choroid is directly adjacent to the retina and consists of a dense vascular network that supplies the outer retina. Pathologies in the choroid can lead to changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors. Thus, the choroid plays a crucial role in the development of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), pathologic myopia, and inflammatory diseases such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH). Basic knowledge of the structure and physiology of the choroid, as well as diagnostic options for visualizing choroidal changes, provides a better understanding of the physiology and pathology of choroidal processes. This review provides an overview of the anatomy and function of the choroid, and describes the diagnostic techniques currently available to characterize and visualize the choroid.

While the role of exosomes in cancer has been studied in-depth, our understanding of their relevance for ocular tissues has just begun to evolve. Intraocular fluids, including aqueous humor and vitreous humor, play a role in nourishing eye tissues and in expelling metabolites. In the pathological state, intraocular exosomes can mediate pathological processes such as ECM remodeling, retinal inflammation, and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction.

      "METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study. Included were 66 eyes of 62 patients who underwent vitrectomy with combined FSIP and ILMF (or modified ILMF) for MTM with a minimal follow-up of 6 months. Thirty-one eyes were treated with FSIP, and 35 with modified ILMF.\n",
      "RESULTS: The post-operative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from 20/148 to 20/87 in the FSIP group (p < 0.001), and from 20/121 to 20/66 in the modified ILMF group (p < 0.001). The post-operative macular thickness (MT) reduced after FSIP (from 739.58 to 223.81 μm, p < 0.001) and modified ILMF (from 706.43 to 236.59 μm, p < .001). The degree of the improvement of BCVA and MT in both groups was insignificant. The incidence of a post-operative macular hole (MH) was 9.7% (3/31 eyes) with FSIP and 0% (0/35 eyes) with modified ILMF. All patients with a MH had foveoschisis in association with a lamellar hole (LMH) pre-operatively. After controlling the surgical technique, pre- and post-operative MT, follow-up duration, myopic atrophy maculopathy, and FD, the surgical technique showed significant effects on post-operative MH in all cases (p = 0.022) and in those with pre-operative LMH (p = 0.029).\n",

      "The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and retinoschisis (RS) in 73 highly myopic (HM) young patients age 16.4 ± 6.9 years and 24 non-HM children age 8.4 ± 1.5 years. The presence of the paravascular retinal abnormalities was determined in the images obtained by a ultra-widefield OCT (UWF OCT) instrument with an image field of 23 × 20 mm. The results showed that a partial PVD was detected in 15 (21%) of the HM patients, and the number increased significantly with increasing age (P = 0.02). PVDs of any type were not found in the non-HM eyes. The number of microvascular folds also increased with age in the HM patients (P = 0.03). Medium-reflective columnar tissues were present between the detached vitreous and inner retinal surface in 4 (5%) eyes of the HM patients. Myopic RS was found in 3 (4%) HM patients in the paravascular area but not in the macular area. These results suggest that early partial PVD may play a role in pathological and proliferative vitreous changes of HM eyes. An intense vitreoretinal traction with bridging tissues may cause the various paravascular retinal abnormalities. In HM eyes, paravascular RS is already present at an early age which may progress to macular RS with aging.\n",

A total of 15 745 medical records with the patients' sex, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), axial length, type of myopic maculopathy, and the presence or absence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were reviewed. Data were analyzed from April 3, 2019, to August 5, 2020.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in the axial length at each examination were calculated. The significance of the associations between the annual increase of the axial length and age, sex, baseline axial length, types of myopic maculopathy, and a history of CNV was determined. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the strength of the risk factors associated with an increase of the axial length in high myopia.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 1877 patients with 9161 visits included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 62.10 (12.92) years, and 1357 (72.30%) were women. The mean (SD) axial length was 29.66 (2.20) mm with a mean (SD) growth rate of 0.05 (0.24) mm/y. Among the 9161 visits, 7096 eyes (77.46%) had myopic maculopathy and 2477 eyes (27.04%) had CNV. The odds ratio for inducing a severe elongation of the axial length was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.38-1.55) for female sex, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.35-0.56) to 0.63 (95% CI, 13 0.50-0.78) for older than 40 years, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.15-1.54) for BCVA of less than 20/400, 1.67 (95% CI, 1.54-1.81) to 2.67 (95% CI, 2.46-2.88) for baseline axial length of 28.15 mm or greater, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.17) to 1.39 (95% CI, 1.24-1.55) for the presence of maculopathy, and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.29-1.47) for prior CNV.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found continuing axial elongation in adults with high myopia. The risk factors for elongation do not appear to be modifiable, so prevention of myopia may be the best approach to reduce the incidence of pathologic myopia and its complications in the future.\n"

Patients were considered to present severe PM if either A or T components were ≥3 and/or N was ≥2.\n",
      "RESULTS: Hundred eyes (53 left) from 91 patients (78 women) were classified. Mean age, BCVA, and axial length values were, respectively, 65.1 ± 11.7 years (range, 36-97 years), -0.63 ± 0.62 (-3.00 to 0.00), and 29.26 ± 2.7 mm (26.01-37.66 mm). Mean ATN grades for each component were as follows: A = 2.51 ± 0.78 (0.6-4.0), T = 0.88 ± 1.14 (0.0-5.0), and N = 1.31 ± 1.40 (0.0-3.0). Weighted interobserver agreement was 98.1%, 98.7%, and 94.6%, for A, T and N, respectively. In eyes with severe PM, BCVA was significantly lower and axial length was significantly longer.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The excellent interobserver rate in this study demonstrates that the updated ATN grading system is an accurate and reliable tool to classify patients with PM. These findings show that BCVA is more compromised in eyes with severe PM, particularly those graded ≥A3 and/or T3.\n"

      " What colour are your eyes? Teaching the genetics of eye colour & colour vision. Edridge Green Lecture RCOphth Annual Congress Glasgow May 2019.\n",
      "Eye colour and colour perception are excellent examples to use when teaching genetics as they encompass not simply the basic Mendelian genetics of dominant, recessive and X-linked disorders, but also many of the new concepts such as non-allelic diseases, polygenic disease, phenocopies, genome-wide association study (GWAS), founder effects, gene-environment interaction, evolutionary drivers for variations, copy number variation, insertions deletions, methylation and gene inactivation. Beyond genetics, colour perception touches on concepts involving optics, physics, physiology and psychology and can capture the imagination of the population, as we saw with social media trend of \"#the dress\". Television shows such as Game of Thrones focused attention on the eye colour of characters, as well as their Dire-wolves and Dragons. These themes in popular culture can be leveraged as tools to teach and engage everyone in genetics, which is now a key component in all eye diseases. As the explosion of data from genomics, big data and artificial intelligence transforms medicine, ophthalmologists need to be genetically literate. Genetics is relevant, not just for Inherited Retinal Diseases and congenital abnormalities but also for the leading causes of blindness: age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, myopia, diabetic retinopathy and cataract. Genetics should be part of the armamentarium of every practicing ophthalmologist. We need to ask every patient about their family history. In the near future, patients will attend eye clinics with genetic results showing they are at high risk of certain eye diseases and ophthalmologists will need to know how to screen, follow and treat these patients.\n"

      " Comparison between Fovea-Sparing and Complete Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling for the Treatment of Myopic Traction Maculopathy: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) is a major cause of impaired vision in eyes with high myopia, which is characterized by retinal thickening, retinoschisis, lamellar macular hole (MH), and foveal retinal detachment. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane peeling (ILMP) has been developed to theoretically prevent postoperative MH formation and improve best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) gain for MTM compared with the complete ILMP. However, in previous studies, the anatomic and visual outcomes still remain uncertain and controversial.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomic and visual outcomes of vitrectomy with fovea-sparing ILMP for the treatment of MTM compared with complete ILMP.\n",
      "METHODS: Articles from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were systematically retrieved. The main outcomes were the rate of a postoperative MH and visual improvement of BCVA (converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]). The secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with visual improvement, the proportion of anatomic success, preoperative and postoperative BCVA, preoperative and postoperative central fovea thickness, and time to anatomic resolution.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was a higher rate of postoperative MH formation (odds ratio [OR] 5.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-18.44; p = 0.004) and less improvement of BCVA in logMAR (mean difference [MD] -0.09; 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.00; p = 0.04) in the complete ILMP group. However, postoperative BCVA (MD 0.14; 95% CI: 0.00-0.27; p = 0.05), the proportion of patients with visual improvement (OR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.15-1.02; p = 0.05), postoperative central foveal thickness (MD -10.02; 95% CI: -24.4 to 4.36; p = 0.17), the rate of anatomic success (MD 0.39; 95% CI: 0.15-1.03; p = 0.06), and time to resolution (MD -1.65; 95% CI: -3.66 to 0.36; p = 0.11) showed no significant differences.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: PPV combined with the fovea-sparing ILMP could contribute to a lower MH formation rate and more improvement of BCVA in logMAR than PPV combined with complete ILMP.\n",

      " Pathologic myopia and severe pathologic myopia: correlation with axial length.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This study had three aims: (1) correlate axial length (AL), age and best-corrected visual acuity in high myopic patients scored on the ATN grading system; (2) determine AL cut-off values to distinguish between pathologic myopia (PM) and severe PM; and (3) identify clinical differences between PM and severe PM.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional study. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, ATN grading and multimodal imaging (colour fundus photography, swept-source OCT, fundus autofluorescence, OCT angiography and fluorescein angiography).\n",
      "RESULTS: Six hundred forty-four eyes from 345 high myopic patients were included. The eyes were graded on the ATN system and classified as PM (≥ A2) or severe PM (≥ A3, ≥ T3 and/or N2). Significant between-group (PM vs. severe PM) differences (p < 0.05) were observed on the individual ATN components (atrophic [A], tractional [T] and neovascular [N]), age, BCVA and AL. AL was also linearly correlated with the A, T and N components (r = 0.53, p < 0.01; r = 0.24, p < 0.01; r = 0.20, p < 0.01; respectively). ROC curve analysis showed the optimal AL cut-off value to distinguish between PM at 28 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.813, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 75%) and severe PM at 29.50 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.760, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 70%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: AL is the main variable associated with myopic maculopathy. Due to the clinical differences found between PM and severe PM, there is need to create an objective cut-off point to distinguish these two different entities being the optimal cut-off points for AL 28 mm and 29.5 mm, respectively. These objective AL cut-off values should be taken into account for determining a correct follow-up, ophthalmic management and treatment.\n"

      " Role of Ultra-widefield Imaging in the evaluation of Long-term change of highly myopic fundus.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of posterior staphyloma identified using ultra-widefield fundus imaging on the long-term progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic patients.\n",
      "METHODS: In this observational cohort study, highly myopic patients who were followed up for at least 5 years using ultra-widefield fundus imaging were analysed for fundus abnormalities and the progression of myopic maculopathy based on the International Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia classification.\n",
      "RESULTS: This study included 390 eyes (210 patients) with the mean follow-up period of 69.2 ± 7.5 months (range, 60-88). Posterior staphyloma was identified in 198 eyes (50.8%) in the baseline ultra-widefield fundus images. The border of staphyloma was not identified within 50° view circle corresponding to conventional fundus photography in 42 eyes (21.2%) with staphyloma, most of that were wide macular type. Progression of myopic maculopathy during follow-up was observed in 202 eyes (51.8%), and eyes with staphyloma were more likely to show progression compared to those without (142/198 [71.7%] versus 60/192 [31.3%]; p < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, the presence of posterior staphyloma was an independent risk factor for the progression of myopic maculopathy (p = 0.005). One or more peripheral retinal lesions were observed in 302 eyes (77.4%) and 321 eyes (82.3%) in the baseline and final ultra-widefield fundus images, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Posterior staphyloma was associated with the long-term progression of myopic maculopathy. With a wider field of view, ultra-widefield fundus imaging is useful for identifying the posterior staphyloma and monitoring the progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic patients.\n"

      " Prevalence Factors Associated With Vision Impairment and Blindness Among Individuals 85 Years and Older in Russia.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Visual performance is important for quality of life. However, vision impairment among adults 85 years and older has not been intensively examined.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of mild vision impairment (VI), moderate to severe vision impairment, and blindness and the factors associated with these conditions among a population 85 years and older.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Ural Very Old Study was a population-based cohort study conducted in rural and urban areas in Bashkortostan, Russia from 2017 to 2020. Among 1882 eligible individuals 85 years and older, 1526 participants (81.1%) were enrolled.\n",
      "EXPOSURES: Ophthalmologic, physical, and mental examinations.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of vision impairment and blindness based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; measured using modified Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts) in the better eye or both eyes. Mild vision impairment was defined as BCVA worse than 6/12 to 6/18, and moderate to severe VI was defined as BCVA worse than 6/18 but equal to or better than 3/60. Blindness was defined as BCVA worse than 3/60.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 1526 participants, 1149 individuals (75.3%; 846 women [73.6%]; mean [SD] age, 88.2 [2.8 years]) had available BCVA measurements and were included in the present analysis. Mild vision impairment was present in 114 individuals (9.9%; 95% CI, 8.2%-11.7%), moderate to severe VI in 562 individuals (48.9%; 95% CI, 46.0%-51.8%), and blindness in 68 individuals (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.3%). Factors associated with moderate to severe VI were cataracts (324 individuals [57.7% of those with moderate to severe VI and 28.2% of total population; 95% CI, 25.6%-30.8%]), secondary cataracts (4 individuals [0.7% of those with moderate to severe VI and 0.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.7%]), age-related macular degeneration (78 individuals [13.9% of those with moderate to severe VI and 6.8% of total population; 95% CI, 5.3%-8.3%]), glaucoma (45 individuals [8.0% of those with moderate to severe VI and 3.9% of total population; 95% CI, 2.8%-5.0%]), corneal opacifications (26 individuals [4.6% of those with moderate to severe VI and 2.3% of total population; 95% CI, 1.4%-3.1%]), myopic maculopathy (13 individuals [2.3% of those with moderate to severe VI and 1.1% of total population; 95% CI, 0.5%-1.7%]), and nonglaucomatous optic nerve damage (4 individuals [0.7% of those with moderate to severe VI and 0.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.7%]). Factors associated with blindness were cataracts (33 individuals [48.5% of those with blindness and 2.9% of total population; 95% CI, 1.9%-3.8%]), age-related macular degeneration (15 individuals [22.1% of those with blindness and 1.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0.7%-2.0%]), glaucoma (7 individuals [10.3% of those with blindness and 0.6% of total population; 95% CI, 0.2%-1.1%]), myopic maculopathy (3 individuals [4.4% of those with blindness and 0.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.6%]), and corneal opacifications (2 individuals [2.9% of those with blindness and 0.2% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%]). Higher moderate to severe VI prevalence was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.28; P < .001), higher blood pressure (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .03), lower hand grip force (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95; P < .001), lower score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98; P < .001), lower prothrombin index (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.97; P < .001), lower refractive error (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.97; P = .006), and lower prevalence of previous cataract surgery (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.68; P < .001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of individuals 85 years and older, the prevalence of moderate to severe VI and blindness was relatively high. Cataracts were the main reversible condition associated with vision loss, and age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy were the main irreversible conditions. Because a higher prevalence of moderate to severe VI was associated with lower cognitive function and physical strength, improvement of vision through increases in cataract surgery and measures to prevent and treat irreversible conditions may help to improve cognitive function and physical strength.\n",

      " Automatic detection of pathological myopia using machine learning.\n",
      "Pathological myopia is a severe case of myopia, i.e., nearsightedness. Pathological myopia is also known as degenerative myopia because it ultimately leads to blindness. In pathological myopia, certain myopia-specific pathologies occur at the eye's posterior i.e., Foster-Fuchs's spot, Cystoid degeneration, Liquefaction, Macular degeneration, Vitreous opacities, Weiss's reflex, Posterior staphyloma, etc. This research is aimed at developing a machine learning (ML) approach for the automatic detection of pathological myopia based on fundus images. A deep learning technique of convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for this purpose. A CNN model is developed in Spyder. The fundus images are first preprocessed. The preprocessed images are then fed to the designed CNN model. The CNN model automatically extracts the features from the input images and classifies the images i.e., normal image or pathological myopia. The best performing CNN model achieved an AUC score of 0.9845. The best validation loss obtained is 0.1457. The results show that the model can be successfully employed to detect pathological myopia from the fundus images.\n"

      " Visualising the choriocapillaris: Histology, imaging modalities and clinical research - A review.\n",
      "The choriocapillaris plays a considerable role in the normal physiology of the eye as well as in various diseases. Assessing the changes in the choriocapillaris can therefore provide important information about normal ageing and pathogenesis of visual impairment, and even some systemic diseases. In vivo imaging of the choriocapillaris has evolved from non-depth resolved, dye-based angiography to advanced, high-resolution optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). However, the intricate microvascular networks within the choriocapillaris are still beyond the resolving limits of most OCTA instruments. Knowledge of histology, meticulous image acquisition methods, recognition of artefact and post-acquisition processing techniques are necessary for optimising OCTA choriocapillaris images. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the choriocapillaris provide clinical information in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), pathologic myopia and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Furthermore, studies have revealed choriocapillaris changes in posterior uveitis that are correlated with treatment outcome and have important prognostic significance. In addition to retinal diseases, choriocapillaris changes have been observed in systemic vascular diseases and complications associated with pregnancy.\n",

      " Cystoid maculopathy is a frequent feature of Cohen syndrome-associated retinopathy.\n",
      "Cohen syndrome (CS) is a rare syndromic form of rod-cone dystrophy. Recent case reports have suggested that cystoid maculopathy (CM) could affect CS patients with an early onset and high prevalence. Our study aims at improving our understanding and management of CM in CS patients through a retrospective case series of ten CS patients with identified pathogenic variants in VPS13B. Longitudinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging was performed and treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) was provided to reduce the volume of cystoid spaces. CM affected eight out of ten patients in our cohort. The youngest patient showed a strong progression of macular cysts from the age of 4.5 to 5 years despite oral CAI medication. Other teenage and young adult patients showed stable macular cysts with and without treatment. One patient showed a moderate decrease of cystoid spaces in the absence of treatment at 22 years of age. Through a correlative analysis we found that the volume of cystoid spaces was positively correlated to the thickness of peripheral and macular photoreceptor-related layers. This study suggests that CAI treatments may not suffice to improve CM in CS patients, and that CM may resolve spontaneously during adulthood as photoreceptor dystrophy progresses.\n"

      "Integrins belong to a group of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) which is a large group of membrane-bound proteins. They are responsible for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and signal transduction from the ECM to the cells. Integrins take part in many other biological activities, such as extravasation, cell-to-cell adhesion, migration, cytokine activation and release, and act as receptors for some viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). They play a pivotal role in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, tissue repair and are involved in the processes that are crucial to infection, inflammation and angiogenesis. Integrins have an important part in normal development and tissue homeostasis, and also in the development of pathological processes in the eye. This review presents the available evidence from human and animal research into integrin structure, classification, function and their role in inflammation, infection and angiogenesis in ocular diseases. Integrin receptors and ligands are clinically interesting and may be promising as new therapeutic targets in the treatment of some eye disorders.\n",

      " Evaluation of retinal vascular density and related factors in youth myopia without maculopathy using OCTA.\n",
      "To evaluate the retinal vascular flow density changes of myopic eyes of young adults using optical coherence tomography angiography and the factors affecting these changes. In this cross-sectional study, 90 eyes of 45 participants were analyzed and divided into three groups: mild, moderate, and high myopia (without pathological changes). Macular and radial peripapillary capillary flow densities were measured using optical coherence tomography angiography. Their relationships with the axial length, the spherical equivalent of the refractive error, and age were analyzed using analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multivariate linear regression analysis. Superficial and deep macular vascular densities were significantly decreased in the high myopia group compared to the other groups. In the high myopia group, the nasal peripapillary flow density decreased, whereas the flow density inside the disc increased. The axial length negatively correlated with the superficial and deep macular vascular density, but positively correlated with the vascular density inside the disc. The spherical equivalent of the refractive error negatively correlated with the macular vascular density. The retinal vascular density decreased in the high myopia group. Hence, the microvascular network inside the disc may have a compensatory action in the hypoxic setting of high myopia.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To explore whether the efficacy of fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane peeling (FS-ILMP) is better than that of complete internal limiting membrane peeling (ILMP).\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective clinical study included 34 cases (34 eyes) with myopic traction maculopathy collected from June 2017 to February 2019. Twenty-three-gauge (23-G) pars plana vitrectomy (23G PPV) was performed on all patients. In the FS-ILMP group, 18 eyes retained the internal limiting membrane (ILM) of about 1 to 1.5 papillary diameter centered on fovea centralis, while in the standard ILMP group, the ILM was completely removed from 16 eyes. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central foveal thickness (CFT), and other indexes were collected before and 6 months after surgery.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups. CFT and BCVA were significantly improved in both FS-ILMP and standard ILMP group, but the postoperative BCVA of the FS-ILMP group was significantly better than that of the standard ILMP group (P < 0.001). Two cases of subretinal effusion in macula were recorded in the FS-ILMP group, and three eyes in the standard ILMP group developed macular holes after surgery. Although both treatments relieved the mechanical traction of macular fovea, the patients in the FS-ILMP group showed better clinical outcomes in various aspects.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: These results improved our understanding of the clinical application of vitrectomy combined with preservation of ILM upon the fovea centralis, which might lay a foundation for in-depth study on the treatment of myopic traction maculopathy.\n"

      " Choroidal shift in myopic eyes in the 10-year follow-up Beijing eye study.\n",
      "The aim of the study was to assess longitudinal changes in the spatial relationship of the choroidal vasculature to retinal vasculature in myopic eyes. In the population-based longitudinal Beijing Eye Study in 2001/2011, we examined all highly myopic eyes with assessable fundus photographs and a randomized group of non-highly myopic. Using fundus photographs, we qualitatively assessed changes in the location of major choroidal vessels in relationship to retinal vessels. The study consisted of 85 highly myopic eyes (58 participants;age:64.8 ± 9.4 years) and 85 randomly selected non-highly myopic eyes. A choroidal shift in relationship to the retinal vessels was detected more often in the highly myopic group than the non-highly myopic group (47/85 (55%) vs 6/85 (7%); P < 0.001). In the highly myopic group, the choroidal vessel shift occurring on the disc-fovea line in 39 (44%) eyes, was similar to, or smaller than, the enlargement in gamma zone width in 26 (67%) eyes and in 11 (28%) eyes respectively. The choroidal vessel shift was larger (P = 0.002) in eyes without choroidal vessels in gamma zone than in eyes with large choroidal vessels in gamma zone. In 14 (17%) eyes, a localized centrifugal choroidal shift was observed in association with an increase in the stage of myopic maculopathy. The results suggest that highly myopic eyes show a change in the position of large choroidal vessels in relationship to retinal vessels, in association with development or enlargement of gamma zone and an increase in the stage of myopic maculopathy.\n"

      " Eye disease and mortality, cognition, disease, and modifiable risk factors: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies.\n",
      "Globally, 2.2 billion people live with some form of vision impairment and/or eye disease. To date, most systematic reviews examining associations have focused on a single eye disease and there is no systematic evaluation of the relationships between eye diseases and diverse physical and mental health outcomes. Moreover, the strength and reliability of the literature is unclear. We performed an umbrella review of observational studies with meta analyses for any physical and/or mental comorbidities associated with eye disease. For each association, random-effects summary effect size, heterogeneity, small-study effect, excess significance bias and 95% prediction intervals were calculated, and used to grade significant evidence from convincing to weak. 34 studies were included covering 58 outcomes. No outcomes yielded convincing evidence, six outcomes yielded highly suggestive results (cataract positively associated with type 2 diabetes, open-angled glaucoma positively associated with myopia and diabetes, diabetic retinopathy positively associated with cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality, and retinopathy of prematurity positively associated with chorioamnionitis), eight outcomes yielded suggestive results (diabetic retinopathy positively associated with all-cause mortality and depression, diabetic macular oedema positively associated with dyslipidaemia, cataract positively associated with gout, nuclear sclerosis positively associated with all-cause mortality, open angled glaucoma positively associated with migraine and hypertension, and age-related macular degeneration positively associated with diabetes), and 18 outcomes yielded weak evidence. Results show highly suggestive or suggestive evidence for associations between several types of eye diseases with several comorbid outcomes. Practitioners and public health policies should note these findings when developing healthcare policies.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To assess the safety of intravitreally applied epidermal growth factor (EGF).\n",
      "METHODS: The clinical interventional, prospective, single-centre, case series study included patients with age-related macular degeneration-related geographic atrophy (GA), in whom the eye with the worse best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) underwent a single, or repeated, intravitreal injection of EGF (0.75 µg in 50 µL). At baseline and afterwards, the eyes underwent ophthalmological examinations.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included seven patients (mean age:70.0±12.2 years (range: 54-86 years), with five patients receiving a single injection and two patients receiving two intravitreal injections in an interval of 4 weeks. Mean duration of follow-up was 97±97 days (median:35 days; range: 7-240 days). Mean BCVA was lower at baseline than at study end (1.41±0.44 logMAR vs 0.97±0.12 logMAR; p=0.03). Mean size of the GA lesions did not differ significantly between baseline and study end (29 212±22 887 pixels vs 29 300±22 905 pixels; p=0.59) nor did the mean perimetric mean defect (-10.3±5.9 dB vs 12.0±8.8 dB; p=0.35) or the electroretinographical b-wave amplitude (44.53±31.7 µV vs 64.5±25.5 µV; p=0.12). After a second injection 4 weeks after the first injection, one of two patients developed a cystoid macular oedema in association with an induced incomplete posterior vitreous detachment. It persisted for 3 weeks. Visual acuity in this eye improved from 1.0 logMAR at baseline to 0.80 logMAR at study end.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Except for one eye with temporary, self-resolving cystoid macular oedema, single and repeated intravitreal applications of EGF (0.75 µg) in patients with GA did not lead to intraocular inflammations or any observed intraocular side effect.\n",

      "MATERIALS: The clinical history, imaging evaluation, treatment and outcomes of 42 eyes in 21 patients diagnosed with IRVAN in a 15-year period were reviewed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Most patients were females (90%) ranged from 15 to 58 years old. The initial decimal best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the patients ranged from light perception (LP) to 1.5 (0.55 ± 0.38). Eighteen eyes were in stage 2; 21 eyes in stage 3; and 1 in stage 5 at the initial visits according to the present staging system. Two eyes had vitreoretinal fibrovascular proliferation (FVP) and tractional retinal detachment (RD) at the initial visit. Intra-retinal microvascular abnormality (IRMA) was found in 7 eyes. Thirty-four eyes received retinal photocoagulation, 27 of which were pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP). Total of 8 PPV were performed for VH, vitreoretinal FVP and RD, and macular epimembrane. Aneurysms on the head of optic nerve and artery bifurcations disappeared in 8 eyes and decreased in number in 2 eyes 1 year after photocoagulation. However, the BCVA of the patients did not have significant difference from that at the initial visits (P = 0.534). Seven eyes suffered severe visual impairment (BCVA ≤ 0.1) due to vitreoretinal FVP and tractional RD (3), exudative maculopathy (2), paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM)(1), and neovascular glaucoma (NVG) (1).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We found that IRVAN have a predilection to female gender. Vitreoretinal FVP and tractional RD and exudative maculopathy are major causes of severe visual impairment in IRVAN patients. We propose to revise the present staging system to include vitreoretinal FVP and RD in the staging of IRVAN patients.\n"

      "The choroid provides nutritional support for the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. Choroidal dysfunction plays a major role in several of the most important causes of vision loss including age-related macular degeneration, myopic degeneration, and pachychoroid diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. We describe an imaging technique using depth-resolved swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) that provides full-thickness three-dimensional (3D) visualization of choroidal anatomy including topographical features of individual vessels. Enrolled subjects with different clinical manifestations within the pachychoroid disease spectrum underwent 15 mm × 9 mm volume scans centered on the fovea. A fully automated method segmented the choroidal vessels using their hyporeflective lumens. Binarized choroidal vessels were rendered in a 3D viewer as a vascular network within a choroidal slab. The network of choroidal vessels was color depth-encoded with a reference to the Bruch's membrane segmentation. Topographical features of the choroidal vasculature were characterized and compared with choroidal imaging obtained with indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) from the same subject. The \n",

      "BACKGROUND: The supervised deep learning approach provides state-of-the-art performance in a variety of fundus image classification tasks, but it is not applicable for screening tasks with numerous or unknown disease types. The unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) approach, which needs only normal samples to develop a model, may be a workable and cost-saving method of screening for ocular diseases.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an AD model for detecting ocular diseases on the basis of color fundus images.\n",
      "METHODS: A generative adversarial network-based AD method for detecting possible ocular diseases was developed and evaluated using 90,499 retinal fundus images derived from 4 large-scale real-world data sets. Four other independent external test sets were used for external testing and further analysis of the model's performance in detecting 6 common ocular diseases (diabetic retinopathy [DR], glaucoma, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, hypertensive retinopathy [HR], and myopia), DR of different severity levels, and 36 categories of abnormal fundus images. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model's performance were calculated and presented.\n",
      "RESULTS: Our model achieved an AUC of 0.896 with 82.69% sensitivity and 82.63% specificity in detecting abnormal fundus images in the internal test set, and it achieved an AUC of 0.900 with 83.25% sensitivity and 85.19% specificity in 1 external proprietary data set. In the detection of 6 common ocular diseases, the AUCs for DR, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, HR, and myopia were 0.891, 0.916, 0.912, 0.867, 0.895, and 0.961, respectively. Moreover, the AD model had an AUC of 0.868 for detecting any DR, 0.908 for detecting referable DR, and 0.926 for detecting vision-threatening DR.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The AD approach achieved high sensitivity and specificity in detecting ocular diseases on the basis of fundus images, which implies that this model might be an efficient and economical tool for optimizing current clinical pathways for ophthalmologists. Future studies are required to evaluate the practical applicability of the AD approach in ocular disease screening.\n",

      "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most common prescription drugs for inflammation, and topical NSAIDs are often used in ophthalmology to reduce pain, photophobia, inflammation, and edema. In recent years, many published reports have found that NSAIDs play an important role in the treatment of retinal neurodegenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, pathological myopia, and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The aim of the current review is to provide an overview of the role of various NSAIDs in the treatment of retinal neurodegenerative diseases and the corresponding mechanisms of action. This review highlighted that the topical application of NSAIDs for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases has been studied to a remarkable extent and that its beneficial effects in many diseases have been proven. In the future, prospective studies with large study populations are required to extend these effects to clinical settings.\n"

      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of treatment naive patients with myopic CNV who received treatment with either intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept over a 12-year period from September 2007 to May 2020 was performed. Baseline features, treatment factors and outcomes were compared between younger and older patients and final visual outcome was assessed for associated factors.\n",
      "RESULTS: Thirty-seven eyes of 36 patients (24 females, 12 males) were included. Mean age was 58 years (range=26-89 years). Of these patients, 11/36 (31%) were ≤50 years of age and 25/36 (69%) were ≥51 years of age. Seventy-three percent (27/37) of eyes were phakic. One patient received bilateral treatment for myopic CNV. Median spherical equivalent was -8.50 diopters. Seventy percent (26/37) of eyes commenced primary treatment with ranibizumab, and 11/37 (30%) eyes commenced treatment with aflibercept. There were no significant differences between treatment factors and outcomes of younger and older patients. Median number of injections was 3 over a median follow-up period of 24.6 months. Mean CRT decreased by 126μm and median visual improvement was +6 letters. Analysis showed that younger age (p=0.022) and fewer injections (p=0.004) were associated with better visual outcomes.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Myopic CNV requires less frequent anti-VEGF intravitreal therapy over a shorter follow-up period than both neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Increased frequency of administration of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment did not improve vision. Younger age is associated with a better final visual outcome. These findings may help to advise patients about the prognosis of treatment and help guide treatment decisions.\n"

      "Nitric oxide (NO) is acknowledged as a vital intercellular messenger in multiple systems in the body. Medicine has focused on its functions and therapeutic applications for decades, especially in cardiovascular and nervous systems, and its role in immunological responses. This review was composed to demonstrate the prevalence of NO in components of the ocular system, including corneal cells and multiple cells in the retina. It discussed NO's assistance during the immune, inflammation and wound-healing processes. NO is identified as a vascular endothelial relaxant that can alter the choroidal blood flow and prompt or suppress vascular changes in age-related macular degeneration and diabetes, as well as the blood supply to the optic nerve, possibly influencing the progression of glaucoma. It will provide a deeper understanding of the role of NO in ocular homeostasis, the delicate balance between overproduction or underproduction and the effect on the processes from aqueous outflow and subsequent intraocular pressure to axial elongation and the development of myopia. This review also recognized the research and investigation of therapies being developed to target the NO complex and treat various ocular diseases.\n",

      " High Myopia and the Complement System: Factor H in Myopic Maculopathy.\n",
      "High myopia (HM) is both a medical problem and refractive error of the eye owing to excessive eyeball length, which progressively makes eye tissue atrophic, and is one of the main causes for diminishing visual acuity in developed countries. Despite its high prevalence and many genetic and proteomic studies, no molecular pattern exists that explain the degenerative process underlying HM, which predisposes patients to other diseases like glaucoma, cataracts, retinal detachment and chorioretinal atrophy that affect the macular area. To determine the relation between complement Factors H (CFH) and D (CFD) and the maculopathy of patients with degenerative myopia, we studied aqueous humor samples that were collected by aspiration from 122 patients during cataract surgery. Eyes were classified according to eyeball axial length as high myopia (axial length > 26 mm), low myopia (axial length 23.5-25.9 mm) and control (axial length ˂ 23.4 mm). The degree of maculopathy was classified according to fundus oculi findings following IMI's classification. Subfoveal choroid thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography. CFH and CFD measurements were taken by ELISA. CFH levels were significantly high in the high myopia group vs. the low myopia and control groups (\n"

      " Myopic Simple Hemorrhage Presenting as Radial Hemorrhage in Henle's Fiber Layer.\n",
      "This case report describes a simple hemorrhage (SH) presenting as radial hemorrhage in Henle's fiber layer (HFL) in a patient with high myopia. A 26-year-old girl with high myopia was referred to our center for sudden onset of decreased vision and a central scotoma in the right eye (OD). Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/100 OD. Fundus examination showed a stellate intraretinal hemorrhage in the fovea of the OD. The hemorrhage was organized in a peculiar petaloid pattern with feathery distal edges, suggesting localization within the radially oriented HFL. The presence of both choroidal neovascularization and microvascular abnormalities consistent with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel 2) were excluded. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of myopic SH was made. At 4-month follow-up BCVA OD spontaneously improved to 20/40, without any treatment been ever administered to the patient. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography OD showed reabsorption of the hemorrhage and almost complete restoration of the foveal architecture. The intraretinal location and spread of the hemorrhage into the HFL in our patient are an unusual presentation of SH, which vividly highlights the anatomy of the fovea. Since fibers in HFL are quite delicate and loosely arranged, this layer is very susceptible to deposition of transudates, exudates, hemorrhage, and other products. Radial hemorrhage in HFL has been originally reported in 4 patients as complication of MacTel 2. It has been previously postulated that it may represent a characteristic finding in MacTel 2 that may develop as a result of microvascular abnormalities of the deep retinal capillary plexus. On the contrary, our data suggest that radial hemorrhage in the HFL does not represent a characteristic finding of MacTel 2, but must rather be considered a non-specific sign with multiple possible etiologies.\n"

She wore soft, daily disposable contact lenses and reported no abnormalities on previous routine eye examinations. At presentation, the patient's uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left. Lensometry revealed a previous refraction of -3.00 + 0.50× 150 in the right eye and -4.00 + 1.75× 174 in the left. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 4 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg by applanation, and central corneal thicknesses were 573 μm and 564 μm in the right and left eyes, respectively. Slitlamp examination revealed an area of scleral thinning near the limbus in the right eye from 5 to 7 o'clock with mild overlying chemosis (Figure 1JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure1/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff). Gonioscopy showed an open angle with mild trabecular meshwork pigmentation in both eyes without any cyclodialysis clefts, peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), or other abnormalities. Dilated fundus examination was significant for mild optic nerve edema and chorioretinal folds in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve confirmed mild disc edema (Figure 2JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure2/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff) and OCT of the macula confirmed mild chorioretinal folds. Anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) and ultrasound biomicroscopy failed to show any other abnormalities. The patient was initially observed without treatment and presented urgently approximately 1 month later with decreased vision and ocular discomfort. Repeat examination revealed an IOP of 31 mm Hg and a focal area of PAS to the previous area of scleral thinning (Figure 3JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure3/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff). In one respect, the newly elevated IOP was considered transiently therapeutic to help reverse the hyperopic shift, disc edema, and hypotony-related maculopathy. However, the situation quickly became more worrisome when shortly thereafter the IOP elevated to 55 mm Hg at subsequent follow-up, and multiple IOP-lowering medications were initiated. Over numerous additional visits, the patient's IOPs ranged from 30 to 39 mm Hg in the right eye despite rapidly advancing to maximally tolerated medical therapy including acetazolamide. She was noted to have a new relative afferent pupillary defect of the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields showed early arcuate defects (Figure 4JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure4/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff). What would be your approach to managing this healthy, young, myopic woman who presented with hypotony due to a spontaneous, perilimbal filtration bleb that later occluded with PAS, resulting in intractably elevated IOP and field loss? What is the differential diagnosis? Would you perform a systemic workup for her initial scleral thinning, and if so, what would you check? Would you intervene for her elevated IOP in the right eye? If so, what would be your surgical approach?\n"

      " Treatment Landscape of Macular Disorders in Indian Patients with the Advent of Razumab™ (World's First Biosimilar Ranibizumab): A Comprehensive Review.\n",
      "Ranibizumab is approved for the treatment of several macular disorders, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV), among others. The unaffordability of the innovator ranibizumab among patients from developing countries such as India led to the development of the world's first biosimilar ranibizumab, which is a cost-effective alternative that does not compromise efficacy and safety. Razumab™, developed and produced by Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India, is the world's first biosimilar of ranibizumab, and is approved in India for the treatment of various macular disorders, including wet AMD, DME, RVO and mCNV. The efficacy and safety of Razumab for the treatment of these macular disorders have been evaluated in both prospective and real-world retrospective studies. Razumab has shown an efficacy similar to that of the innovator ranibizumab, achieving improved visual acuity, as measured by the best corrected visual acuity, and reduction in the central macular thickness, leading to improved patient outcomes. The safety profile of Razumab is comparable to that of the innovator ranibizumab and is well tolerated without any new safety concerns. Here, we review the clinical and real-world data of Razumab in the treatment of macular disorders.\n"

      "AIM: To document with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography the morphological regeneration of the fovea after resolution of cystoid macular edema (CME) without and with internal limiting membrane (ILM) detachment and to discuss the presumed role of the glial scaffold for foveal structure stabilization.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective case series of 38 eyes of 35 patients is described. Of these, 17 eyes of 16 patients displayed foveal regeneration after resolution of CME, and 6 eyes of 6 patients displayed CME with ILM detachment. Eleven eyes of 9 patients displayed other kinds of foveal and retinal disorders associated with ILM detachment.\n",
      "RESULTS: The pattern of edematous cyst distribution, with or without a large cyst in the foveola and preferred location of cysts in the inner nuclear layer or Henle fiber layer (HFL), may vary between different eyes with CME or in one eye during different CME episodes. Large cysts in the foveola may be associated with a tractional elevation of the inner foveal layers and the formation of a foveoschisis in the HFL. Edematous cysts are usually not formed in the ganglion cell layer. Eyes with CME and ILM detachment display a schisis between the detached ILM and nerve fiber layer (NFL) which is traversed by Müller cell trunks. ILM detachment was also found in single eyes with myopic traction maculopathy, macular pucker, full-thickness macular holes, outer lamellar holes, and glaucomatous parapapillary retinoschisis, and in 3 eyes with Müller cell sheen dystrophy (MCSD). As observed in eyes with MCSD, cellophane maculopathy, and macular pucker, respectively, fundus light reflections can be caused by different highly reflective membranes or layers: the thickened and tightened ILM which may or may not be detached from the NFL, the NFL, or idiopathic epiretinal membranes. In eyes with short single or multiple CME episodes, the central fovea regenerated either completely, which included the disappearance of irregularities of the photoreceptor layer lines and the reformation of a fovea externa, or with remaining irregularities of the photoreceptor layer lines.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The examples of a complete regeneration of the foveal morphology after transient CME show that the fovea may withstand even large tractional deformations and has a conspicuous capacity of structural regeneration as long as no cell degeneration occurs. It is suggested that the regenerative capacity depends on the integrity of the threedimensional glial scaffold for foveal structure stabilization composed of Müller cell and astrocyte processes. The glial scaffold may also maintain the retinal structure after loss of most retinal neurons as in late-stage MCSD.\n"

      "Aflibercept is a fully human recombinant fusion protein that includes the second domain of human VEGF receptor 1 and the third domain of human VEGF receptor 2. Despite the important role played by VEGF in maintaining the physiological condition of the retina under normal conditions, dysregulation of VEGF can result in pathological alterations including hyperpermeability of the retinal capillaries and migration and proliferation of retinal endothelial cells. Over the years, a number of studies have evaluated the use of intravitreal aflibercept in different retinal diseases.

      "Myopia has become an important global public health problem, especially in East Asia. Due to its high prevalence and multiple ocular complications, it is imperative to take effective measures against the development of myopia. Recent studies have shown that outdoor activity is one of the protective factors for myopia and sunlight can delay the progression of myopia. As a possible mediator between sunlight and myopia, vitamin D gradually comes into public view. Vitamin D refers to a kind of secosteroids responsible for regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism. In addition to this main function, it is also correlated with many eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma etc. This review summarizes relevant epidemiologic and genetic studies as well as possible biological mechanisms to provide theoretical reference for the plausible application of vitamin D in the prevention and therapy of myopia.

      "Pathological myopia, an important blinding eye disease worldwide, has caused a heavy social burden. The patients have become younger in recent years. In general, people have limited knowledge of pathological myopia. They often confuse pathological myopia with high myopia, and do not fully realize that pathological myopia is not only an ametropia disease, but also a fundus disease. Fundus complications of pathological myopia are the main causes of visual impairment, including posterior staphyloma, macular degeneration, and secondary choroidal neovascularization. All of them are related to axial length and can progress throughout the life, while the treatment is limited. At present, myopia prevention has become a national strategy, and pathological myopia is the key and difficult point in myopia prevention. The whole society should pay attention to the prevention and treatment for fundus complications of pathological myopia, take comprehensive measures, and increase scientific researches to protect the eye health of the people.

      " Association of Aberrant Posterior Vitreous Detachment and Pathologic Tractional Forces With Myopic Macular Degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the tractional elements of pathologic myopia (PM; e.g. myopic traction maculopathy [MTM], posterior staphyloma [PS], and aberrant posterior vitreous detachment [PVD]) are associated with myopic macular degeneration (MMD) independent of age and axial length, among highly myopic (HM) eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine individuals with 239 HM eyes from the Myopic and Pathologic Eyes in Singapore (MyoPES) cohort underwent ocular biometry, fundus photography, swept-source optical coherence tomography, and ocular B-scan ultrasound. Images were analyzed for PVD grade, and presence of MTM, PS, and MMD. The χ² test was done to determine the difference in prevalence of MMD between eyes with and without PVD, PS, and MTM. Multivariate probit regression analyses were performed to ascertain the relationship between the potential predictors (PVD, PS, and MTM) and outcome variable (MMD), after accounting for possible confounders (e.g. age and axial length). Marginal effects were reported.\n",
      "RESULTS: Controlling for potential confounders, eyes with MTM have a 29.92 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD (P = 0.003), and eyes with PS have a 25.72 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD (P = 0.002). The likelihood of MMD increases by 10.61 percentage points per 1 mm increase in axial length (P < 0.001). Subanalysis revealed that eyes with incomplete PVD have a 22.54 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD than eyes with early PVD (P = 0.04).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated an association between tractional (MTM, PS, and persistently incomplete PVD) and degenerative elements of PM independent of age and axial length. These data provide further insights into the pathogenesis of MMD.\n"

      "METHODS: The agreement test for MSS was based on the evaluation of 104 optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans from 104 myopic eyes. According to the MSS, six observers were asked to identify, in each image, one among four retinal patterns and one among three foveal patterns of MTM, the presence of an outer lamellar macular hole (OLMH) and an epiretinal membrane (ERM). Each observer repeated the agreement test after a 60 days interval.\n",
      "RESULTS: Inter-observer reliability: the agreement of the test for the retina pattern was substantial (0.724), for the fovea pattern was 0.821, for the OLMH was 0.656, and for the ERM was 0.463. When all the criteria are included in the validation test the agreement was 0.657. Regarding the weighted statistics (Gwet's AC2, 95% CI), the validation test was statistically significant both when the variables were considered one by one, with an excellent agreement, respectively for the retina pattern (0.955) and the fovea pattern (0.963) and when all the variables were included in the tests (0.930). Intra-observer repeatability: all observers rerun the test after 2 months with a statistically significant percentage of confirmation of the previous test.\n",

However, accurate diagnosis depends on multimodal imaging and the expertise of retinal ophthalmologists.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning model to detect treatment-requiring retinal vascular diseases using multimodal imaging.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled participants with multimodal ophthalmic imaging data from 3 hospitals in Taiwan from 2013 to 2019. Eye-related images were used, including those obtained through retinal fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography with or without indocyanine green angiography (FA/ICGA). A deep learning model was constructed for detecting DME, nAMD, mCNV, BRVO, and CRVO and identifying treatment-requiring diseases. Model performance was evaluated and is presented as the area under the curve (AUC) for each receiver operating characteristic curve.\n",

During the trial period, the clinical team processed 19 alerts, on average in fewer than 6 days. Decreases in visual acuity were detected with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 99%.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: The use of connected and mobile devices today is widespread, as is interest in mobile medical applications. Long-term treatments for maculopathies can be a difficult burden to bear, both for patients and healthcare practitioners. Overcoming the challenges associated with the successful remote detection of recurrences thus represents a significant opportunity for improving patient care. The implementation of novel digital tools requires the cooperation of the clinical team as a whole, to both inform and motivate patients. OdySight demonstrates satisfactory detection rates, thanks to reliable and reproducible home testing, and can thus serve as a supplementary tool for patients whose consultations are often spaced several months apart. Implementation can be nonetheless improved by facilitating alert processing, a goal which necessitates active adaptation of clinical practices. In general, active patients were very satisfied with this personalized service.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Improved medical support, plus the amusing nature of the tests and games, both bolster long-term use of the OdySight app. The application allows for the remote monitoring of changes in visual acuity and affords patients and practitioners an added level of protection, particularly during long intervals between treatments and at the end of a treatment course. To ensure proper implementation, clinics should focus on reinforcing and modernizing the clinical pathway, from patient intake to the injection room.\n"

      " Correlation of morphological characteristics of staphyloma with the structural and functional outcomes of myopic traction maculopathy after macular buckle surgery.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To compare morphological features of staphyloma (type and grade) with structural and functional outcomes in 11 patients with symptomatic myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM) who underwent macular buckle surgery.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective observational case series, where a chart review was conducted of the type (Curtin classification) and grade of staphyloma (USG B-scan based). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) macula analysis done preoperatively and postoperatively 1 and 6-8 weeks), Visual acuity was recorded in log mar.\n",
      "RESULTS: With an average myopia of -10.35 D (-5 to -14.5 D), there were four patients with types II and IX staphyloma and seven with type I staphyloma. The average axial length was 28.6 ± 0.98 mm in type II/IX and 26.2 ± 0.8 mm in type I. Preoperative OCT features were outer retinal layer schisis (11), retinal detachment (foveal: 2, macular: 8), macular hole (lamellar: 3, full thickness: 4), and taut posterior hyaloid (3). Postoperatively, patients with type II/IX staphyloma had significant gain in visual acuity from 1.05 ± 0.3 to 0.74 ± 0.2 Log Mar. The structural features also responded better in patients with types II/IX staphyloma, with all patients having more than 90% reduction in schisis and retinal attachment at 6 weeks. Whereas only two patients with type I staphyloma had similar reduction in schisis at 6 weeks and only one had complete retinal attachment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In patients with MTM, the staphyloma characteristics preoperatively can help us prognosticate about structural and functional success after macular buckle surgery. In our small case series, patients with type II/IX staphyloma and larger axial length had better structural and functional outcomes.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in vitrectomy compared with traditional complete ILM peeling in vitreomacular interface diseases, including macular hole (MH), epiretinal membrane, macular foveoschisis, myopic traction maculopathy, and the like.\n",
      "METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, CNKI Databases, and the ClinicalTrials.gov website (PROSPERO number CRD42020187401) were searched. Controlled trials comparing fovea-sparing with complete ILM peeling were included. Postoperative changes in best-corrected visual acuity, central retinal thickness in vitreomacular interface diseases, the incidence of MH closure in MH cases, full-thickness macular hole development in non-MH cases, and retinal reattachment in retinoschisis cases were extracted.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fourteen studies (487 eyes) were eligible. Compared with complete ILM peeling, the fovea-sparing technique revealed significant improvement in best-corrected visual acuity ( logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution; weighted mean difference = -0.70; 95% confidence interval, -1.11 to -0.30), and a reduced incidence of full-thickness macular hole was noted in non-MH cases (risk ratios = 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.76). However, no significant differences in mean change in central retinal thickness, incidence of MH closure in MH cases, and retinal reattachment in retinoschisis cases were noted.\n",

      " Estimation of ocular axial length with optometric parameters is not accurate.\n",
      "UNLABELLED: Myopia is a worldwide major public concern, aside from the visual disturbance needing optical correction, myopia may be associated with open angle glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic maculopathy. The higher the myopia the higher the risk for retinal associated comorbidities, and the axial length is the more important measure to estimate risk of visual impairment. Recently a formula to predict axial length using spherical equivalent and keratometry was proposed, with the intention of categorizing the risk of visual impairment with Tideman et al. classification.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of an axial length prediction formula in a Colombian population 8-17 years old.\n",
      "METHODS: Children from MIOPUR study with optical biometer axial length measure (AL), manifest refraction and keratometry were included in the analysis. Predicted axial length (PAL) was calculated with the prediction formula. A Bland-Altman assessment was conducted, and the concordance correlation coefficient was measured. Proposed classification of AL to establish risk of visual loss was used with measured AL and with PAL. The percentage of eyes misclassified was then established.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 2129 eyes were included in the analysis. Mean difference of axial length (actual AL minus PAL) was -0.516 mm (-1.559 mm - 0.528 mm). Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.656 (IC95 0.636-0.675) was found between the real AL and PAL. PAL differed from measured AL by 1 mm or more in 16.58 %, and by 2 mm or more, in 0.61 % of the eyes. In myopic eyes, PAL was in average 0.426 mm longer than the AL actually measured with CCC of 0.714 (IC95 0.666-0.761). PAL differed from measured AL by 1 mm or more in 21.92 %, and by 2 mm or more, in 0.45 % of the myopic eyes. The study revealed that 15.03 % of all eyes, and 29.81 % of myopic eyes, were misclassified when PAL was used.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The proposed axial length prediction formula was not accurate, and it did not adequately classify risk of visual impairment in myopic eyes in a group of Colombian children. We consider that it is not possible to predict the axial length based only on optometric data, such as the corneal radius of curvature and the spherical equivalent. This is very possibly related to the variability of crystalline lens power within a population.\n",

      " The Risks and Benefits of Myopia Control.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The prevalence of myopia is increasing around the world, stimulating interest in methods to slow its progression. The primary justification for slowing myopia progression is to reduce the risk of vision loss through sight-threatening ocular pathologic features in later life. The article analyzes whether the potential benefits of slowing myopia progression by 1 diopter (D) justify the potential risks associated with treatments.\n",
      "METHODS: First, the known risks associated with various methods of myopia control are summarized, with emphasis on contact lens wear. Based on available data, the risk of visual impairment and predicted years of visual impairment are estimated for a range of incidence levels. Next, the increased risk of potentially sight-threatening conditions associated with different levels of myopia are reviewed. Finally, a model of the risk of visual impairment as a function of myopia level is developed, and the years of visual impairment associated with various levels of myopia and the years of visual impairment that could be prevented with achievable levels of myopia control are estimated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Assuming an incidence of microbial keratitis between 1 and 25 per 10 000 patient-years and that 15% of cases result in vision loss leads to the conclusion that between 38 and 945 patients need to be exposed to 5 years of wear to produce 5 years of vision loss. Each additional 1 D of myopia is associated with a 58%, 20%, 21%, and 30% increase in the risk of myopic maculopathy, open-angle glaucoma, posterior subcapsular cataract, and retinal detachment, respectively. The predicted mean years of visual impairment ranges from 4.42 in a person with myopia of -3 D to 9.56 in a person with myopia of -8 D, and a 1-D reduction would lower these by 0.74 and 1.21 years, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits of myopia control outweigh the risks: the number needed to treat to prevent 5 years of visual impairment is between 4.1 and 6.8, whereas fewer than 1 in 38 will experience a loss of vision as a result of myopia control.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate retinal sensitivity of highly myopic eyes without choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) or patchy chorioretinal atrophy (PCA) and investigated its association with anatomical characteristics including melanin distribution at the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which was evaluated with polarisation-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT).\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive observational cohort study.\n",
      "METHODS: We included highly myopic eyes (refractive error ≤-8.0 dioptres or axial length of ≥26.5 mm) from patients at the University of Tokyo Hospital. Retinal sensitivity was measured by microperimetry at 25 sectors within 6 degrees from the fovea. Depolarisation value, which reflected melanin pigmentation, was measured by a clinical prototype of PS-OCT and was parameterised as polarimetric entropy. Retinal sensitivity or entropy at the RPE in high myopia was compared with emmetropic control subjects. The association of retinal sensitivity with age, axial length, entropy, or choroidal thickness was assessed in per-eye and per-sector analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-three highly myopic eyes (age, 66.6±12.3 years) were included. The average retinal sensitivity was 25.3±3.0 dB, which was significantly decreased compared with the control (p<0.0001). The average entropy at the RPE in the highly myopic eyes was significantly lower than in the control (p<0.0001). Univariate analysis followed by multivariate analysis showed that besides age, axial length or choroidal thickness, RPE entropy was independently associated with retinal sensitivity (β=4.4; 95% CI 0.5 to 8.3; p=0.03).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Decreased depolarisation at the RPE measured with PS-OCT, which reflected altered melanin pigmentation, was independently associated with reduced retinal sensitivity in patients with early stages of myopic maculopathy without CNV or PCA.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Delayed Dark-Adapted vision Recovery (DAR) is a biomarker for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), however its measurement is burdensome for patients and examiners.\n",
      "METHODS: In this study, we developed a portable, wireless and user-friendly system that employs a headset with a smartphone to deliver controlled photo-bleach and monocular pattern reversal stimuli, while using custom electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes and electronics in order to measure Dark-Adapted Visual Evoked Potentials (DAVEP) objectively and separately at the peripheral and central visual field. This is achieved in one comfortable 20-minute session, without requiring subject reporting. DAVEP responses post photo-bleach for up to 15 minutes were measured concurrently from both eyes in 12 AMD-patients, 1 degenerative myopia patient, and 8 controls who had no diagnosed macular vision loss.\n",
      "RESULTS: Robust positive polarity DAVEP responses were observed at 200-500 ms from stimulus onset to scotopic stimuli that have been seldom reported and analyzed previously. The amplitude recovery of the DAVEP response was significantly delayed in AMD patients as compared to controls. We developed DAVEP1 scores, a simple metric for DAR, which classified 90% of subject eyes correctly, indicating the presence of AMD in at least one eye of all pre-confirmed subjects with this diagnosis.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We developed a user-friendly, portable VEP system and DAVEP1 metric, which show a high potential to identify DAR-deficits in AMD-patients. This novel technology could aid in early diagnosis of AMD.\n",

      "To evaluate the efficacy and complications of cataract surgery in high myopia, a comprehensive search query was conducted from January 2000 to August 2020. A total of 19 586 highly myopic eyes from 28 studies were included. Modern cataract surgery turns out efficacious in highly myopic eyes with significant improvement of visual acuity. However, phacoemulsification-related complications such as posterior capsular rupture (3.91%, 95% CI, 1.98%-6.37%), retinal detachment (1.74%, 95% CI, 1.36%-2.15%), progressed myopic traction maculopathy (5.07%, 95% CI, 1.80%-9.37%), capsular contraction syndrome (2.1%), intraocular lens dislocation (0.58%), and transient intraocular pressure elevation (28.15%, 95% CI, 20.29%-36.70%) occurred more frequently in the highly myopic population. Separate analyses were also conducted based on follow-up period. In conclusion, modern cataract surgery was effective for highly myopic cataract patients, whereas careful precautions and sufficient follow-ups were of great value because of higher incidences of intraoperative and postoperative complications.\n"

      " IMI Impact of Myopia.\n",
      "The global burden of myopia is growing. Myopia affected nearly 30% of the world population in 2020 and this number is expected to rise to 50% by 2050. This review aims to analyze the impact of myopia on individuals and society; summarizing the evidence for recent research on the prevalence of myopia and high myopia, lifetime pathological manifestations of myopia, direct health expenditure, and indirect costs such as lost productivity and reduced quality of life (QOL). The principal trends are a rising prevalence of myopia and high myopia, with a disproportionately greater increase in the prevalence of high myopia. This forecasts a future increase in vision loss due to uncorrected myopia as well as high myopia-related complications such as myopic macular degeneration. QOL is affected for those with uncorrected myopia, high myopia, or complications of high myopia. Overall the current global cost estimates related to direct health expenditure and lost productivity are in the billions. Health expenditure is greater in adults, reflecting the added costs due to myopia-related complications. Unless the current trajectory for the rising prevalence of myopia and high myopia change, the costs will continue to grow. The past few decades have seen the emergence of several novel approaches to prevent and slow myopia. Further work is needed to understand the life-long impact of myopia on an individual and the cost-effectiveness of the various novel approaches in reducing the burden.\n",

      " IMI Pathologic Myopia.\n",
      "Pathologic myopia is a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. Pathologic myopia is distinctly different from high myopia. High myopia is a high degree of myopic refractive error, whereas pathologic myopia is defined by a presence of typical complications in the fundus (posterior staphyloma or myopic maculopathy equal to or more serious than diffuse choroidal atrophy). Pathologic myopia often occurs in eyes with high myopia, however its complications especially posterior staphyloma can also occur in eyes without high myopia. Owing to a recent advance in ocular imaging, an objective and accurate diagnosis of pathologic myopia has become possible. Especially, optical coherence tomography has revealed novel lesions like dome-shaped macula and myopic traction maculopathy. Wide-field optical coherence tomography has succeeded in visualizing the entire extent of large staphylomas. The effectiveness of new therapies for complications have been shown, such as anti-VEGF therapies for myopic macular neovascularization and vitreoretinal surgery for myopic traction maculopathy. Myopia, especially childhood myopia, has been increasing rapidly in the world. In parallel with an increase in myopia, the prevalence of high myopia has also been increasing. However, it remains unclear whether or not pathologic myopia will increase in parallel with an increase of myopia itself. In addition, it has remained unclear whether genes responsible for pathologic myopia are the same as those for myopia in general, or whether pathologic myopia is genetically different from other myopia.\n"

      " IMI Prevention of Myopia and Its Progression.\n",
      "The prevalence of myopia has markedly increased in East and Southeast Asia, and pathologic consequences of myopia, including myopic maculopathy and high myopia-associated optic neuropathy, are now some of the most common causes of irreversible blindness. Hence, strategies are warranted to reduce the prevalence of myopia and the progression to high myopia because this is the main modifiable risk factor for pathologic myopia. On the basis of published population-based and interventional studies, an important strategy to reduce the development of myopia is encouraging schoolchildren to spend more time outdoors. As compared with other measures, spending more time outdoors is the safest strategy and aligns with other existing health initiatives, such as obesity prevention, by promoting a healthier lifestyle for children and adolescents. Useful clinical measures to reduce or slow the progression of myopia include the daily application of low-dose atropine eye drops, in concentrations ranging between 0.01% and 0.05%, despite the side effects of a slightly reduced amplitude of accommodation, slight mydriasis, and risk of an allergic reaction; multifocal spectacle design; contact lenses that have power profiles that produce peripheral myopic defocus; and orthokeratology using corneal gas-permeable contact lenses that are designed to flatten the central cornea, leading to midperipheral steeping and peripheral myopic defocus, during overnight wear to eliminate daytime myopia. The risk-to-benefit ratio needs to be weighed up for the individual on the basis of their age, health, and lifestyle. The measures listed above are not mutually exclusive and are beginning to be examined in combination.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Myopic maculopathy (MM) is the most serious and irreversible complication of pathologic myopia, which is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. Clinic proposed limited number of factors related to MM. To explore additional features strongly related with MM from optic disc region, we employ a machine learning based radiomics analysis method, which could explore and quantify more hidden or imperceptible MM-related features to the naked eyes and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of MM and therefore may assist to distinguish the high-risk population in an early stage.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 457 eyes (313 patients) were enrolled and were divided into severe MM group and without severe MM group. Radiomics analysis was applied to depict features significantly correlated with severe MM from optic disc region. Receiver Operating Characteristic were used to evaluate these features' performance of classifying severe MM.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eight new MM-related image features were discovered from the optic disc region, which described the shapes, textural patterns and intensity distributions of optic disc region. Compared with clinically reported MM-related features, these newly discovered features exhibited better abilities on severe MM classification. And the mean values of most features were markedly changed between patients with peripapillary diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (PDCA) and macular diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (MDCA).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning and radiomics method are useful tools for mining more MM-related features from the optic disc region, by which complex or even hidden MM-related features can be discovered and decoded. In this paper, eight new MM-related image features were found, which would be useful for further quantitative study of MM-progression. As a nontrivial byproduct, marked changes between PDCA and MDCA was discovered by both new image features and clinic features.\n"

      " Intra- and interobserver concordance of a new classification system for myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopic maculopathy (MM) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and irreversible blindness in eyes with pathologic myopia (PM). However, the classification of each type of lesion associated with MM has not been determined. Recently, a new MM classification system, known as the ATN grading and classification system, was proposed; it is based on the fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and includes three variable components: atrophy (A), traction (T), and neovascularization (N). This study aimed to perform an independent evaluation of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the recently developed ATN grading system for MM.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Fundus photographs and OCT images of 125 patients (226 eyes) with various MMs were evaluated and classified using the ATN grading of the new MM classification system by four blinded and independent evaluators (2 attending ophthalmologists and 2 ophthalmic residents). All cases were randomly re-evaluated by the same observers after an interval of 6 weeks. The kappa coefficient (κ) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the interobserver and intraobserver agreement.\n",
      "RESULTS: The interobserver agreement was substantial when considering the maculopathy type (A, T, and N). The weighted Fleiss κ values for each MM type (A, T, and N) were 0.651 (95% CI: 0.602-0.700), 0.734 (95% CI: 0.689-0.779), and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.649-0.755), respectively. The interobserver agreement when considering the subtypes was good or excellent, except for stages A1, A2, and N1, in which the weighted κ value was less than 0.6, with moderate agreement. The intraobserver agreement of types and subtypes was excellent, with κ > 0.8. No significant differences were observed between the attending ophthalmologists and residents for interobserver reliability or intraobserver reproducibility.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The ATN classification allows an adequate agreement among ophthalmologists with different qualifications and by the same observer on separate occasions. Future prospective studies should further evaluate whether this classification can be better implemented in clinical decision-making and disease progression assessments.\n",

However, developing such automatic solutions is challenging due to the requirement of a large amount of training data and the expensive annotations for medical images. This paper presents a novel self-supervised learning framework for retinal disease diagnosis to reduce the annotation efforts by learning the visual features from the unlabeled images. To achieve this, we present a rotation-oriented collaborative method that explores rotation-related and rotation-invariant features, which capture discriminative structures from fundus images and also explore the invariant property used for retinal disease classification. We evaluate the proposed method on two public benchmark datasets for retinal disease classification. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other self-supervised feature learning methods (around 4.2% area under the curve (AUC)). With a large amount of unlabeled data available, our method can surpass the supervised baseline for pathologic myopia (PM) and is very close to the supervised baseline for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), showing the potential benefit of our method in clinical practice.\n"

      " Retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithms for myopia and a blockchain platform to facilitate artificial intelligence medical research: a retrospective multicohort study.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: By 2050, almost 5 billion people globally are projected to have myopia, of whom 20% are likely to have high myopia with clinically significant risk of sight-threatening complications such as myopic macular degeneration. These are diagnoses that typically require specialist assessment or measurement with multiple unconnected pieces of equipment. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches might be effective for risk stratification and to identify individuals at highest risk of visual loss. However, unresolved challenges for AI medical studies remain, including paucity of transparency, auditability, and traceability.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective multicohort study, we developed and tested retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithms for detection of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia, using a total of 226 686 retinal images. First we trained and internally validated the algorithms on datasets from Singapore, and then externally tested them on datasets from China, Taiwan, India, Russia, and the UK. We also compared the performance of the deep learning algorithms against six human experts in the grading of a randomly selected dataset of 400 images from the external datasets. As proof of concept, we used a blockchain-based AI platform to demonstrate the real-world application of secure data transfer, model transfer, and model testing across three sites in Singapore and China.\n",
      "FINDINGS: The deep learning algorithms showed robust diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUC] of 0·969 (95% CI 0·959-0·977) or higher for myopic macular degeneration and 0·913 (0·906-0·920) or higher for high myopia across the external testing datasets with available data. In the randomly selected dataset, the deep learning algorithms outperformed all six expert graders in detection of each condition (AUC of 0·978 [0·957-0·994] for myopic macular degeneration and 0·973 [0·941-0·995] for high myopia). We also successfully used blockchain technology for data transfer, model transfer, and model testing between sites and across two countries.\n",
      "INTERPRETATION: Deep learning algorithms can be effective tools for risk stratification and screening of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia among the large global population with myopia. The blockchain platform developed here could potentially serve as a trusted platform for performance testing of future AI models in medicine.\n",

      "AIMS: To characterise the association between visual field (VF) defects and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in highly myopic adults without glaucoma.\n",
      "METHODS: Participants (n=106; 181 eyes) with high myopia (HM; spherical equivalent ≤-5.0 D or axial length (AL) ≥26 mm), after excluding glaucoma and glaucoma suspects, from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases-HM study were included in this cross-sectional study. Humphrey VF (central 24-2 threshold), cup-disc ratio (CDR) and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed. Mean deviation (MD) and pattern SD (PSD), VF defects (normal or abnormal; p<0.05 in ≥3 non-edge contiguous locations) and pattern (eg, generalised sensitivity loss) were analysed. MMD presence was diagnosed from fundus photographs. Generalised estimating equations were used for analysing factors (MD, PSD, VF defects, CDR and IOP) associated with MMD.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean age was 55.4±9.9 years and 51.9% were women (AL=26.7±1.1 mm). MMD eyes had lower MD (-3.8±2.9 dB vs -1.1±1.4 dB) and higher PSD (2.8±1.7 dB vs 1.7±0.6 dB). A higher percentage of MMD eyes (n=48) had abnormal VF (62.5% vs 28.6%; p<0.001) compared with no MMD (n=133 eyes). VF pattern in MMD eyes was significantly different from eyes without MMD (p=0.001) with greater generalised sensitivity loss (53.3% vs 10.5%) and arcuate defects (16.7% vs 10.5%). In multivariate analyses, MD (OR=1.52) and PSD (OR=1.67) were significantly (p=0.003) associated with MMD, but VF defects were not associated with MMD.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Highly myopic adults with MMD may have VF loss when compared with highly myopic patients without MMD even in adults without glaucoma.\n"

      " Review on current concepts of myopia and its control strategies.\n",
      "Myopia poses a significant burden on the healthcare system, economy and quality of life. It is an emerging global public health challenge and requires interventions to delay or stop onset and progression. With changing times and evidence, the concepts of myopia are changing along with the treatment and control strategies. Behavioural modifications including increased outdoors time and reduced near work, optical and pharmaceutical management options are reviewed. This paper presents a current overview on the concepts of myopia, and is expected to summarize updates on myopia control methods.\n",

      " Dome-shaped maculopathy: a review.\n",
      "First described by Gaucher and associates in 2008 in eyes with high myopia, dome-shaped maculopathy (DSM) is an anterior convex protrusion of the macula towards the vitreous cavity observable on OCT. This seems to be related to a localized scleral thickness, which might be the result of regional variation in the scleral bio-mechanical properties and the process of emmetropization causing asymmetric scleral growth. The presence of DSM can be associated with an increased risk of complications. The clinical spectrum ranges from being asymptomatic to metamorphopsia and mild-to-moderate gradual visual loss over years. Visual impairment in DSM results from retinal pigment epithelial changes, sub-foveal serous detachment, retinoschisis and myopic choroidal neovascularization. In this review, we compile and review the available information on the pathophysiology, nomenclature, classification, clinical features including imaging, differential diagnosis, complications associated with DSM and the gaps in our understanding of this entity thus far.\n"

      " Cardiovascular Adverse Events With Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Drugs: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Systemic safety of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is a matter of debate and regular updates are necessary.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate systemic adverse events (SAEs) associated with intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs compared with non-anti-VEGF treatments in patients with ocular diseases.\n",
      "DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from inception to July 7, 2020.\n",
      "STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials conducted in adults with retinal diseases who received intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs.\n",
      "DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Studies and treatment characteristics and outcome data were extracted and analyzed, and study quality was evaluated.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were major cardiovascular events (MACEs) and total mortality. Secondary outcomes included nonocular hemorrhage, components of MACEs, other cardiovascular outcomes, serious SAEs, and all SAEs.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 74 randomized clinical trials were analyzed: 32 trials (43%) included 14 190 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 24 (32%) included 5424 patients with diabetic retinopathy (diabetic macular edema or proliferative diabetic retinopathy), 17 trials (23%) included 3757 patients with retinal vein occlusion, and 1 trial (1%) included 122 patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization. Anti-VEGF drug administration did not increase MACEs compared with control agents (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% CI, 0.85-1.58) or total mortality (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.82-1.96). There was an interaction (subgroup difference, P = .04) in mortality risk depending on the underlying disease with an increase (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.03-3.16; P = .04) in the risk of death in patients with diabetic retinopathy; however, no increase was observed in patients with AMD or retinal vein occlusion. Administration of anti-VEGF drugs increased the risk of nonocular hemorrhage (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.01-2.10), mainly in patients with AMD.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intravitreal anti-VEGF was not associated with an increase in MACEs in the trials examined herein. Increased mortality in patients with diabetes and nonocular hemorrhages, especially in those with AMD, could represent a safety signal, but the evidence was not strong. However, continued surveillance of SAEs remains warranted.\n",

      " Decreased choroidal and scleral thicknesses in highly myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma.\n",
      "In this cross-sectional study, we investigated choroidal thickness (CT) and scleral thickness (ST) in highly myopic eyes and their associations with ocular factors. Patients underwent widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure the CT and ST at the subfovea and 3000 μm superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal to the fovea and macular curvature. A total of 237 eyes (154 patients) were included. At all five measurement points, thinner CTs and STs were associated with longer axial lengths (r = - 0.548 to - 0.357, all P < 0.001) and greater macular curvatures (r = - 0.542 to - 0.305, all P < 0.001). The CT and ST were significantly thinner in eyes with posterior staphyloma than in those without at all measurement points (all P ≤ 0.006) but did not differ between eyes with the wide macular and narrow macular type of staphyloma. Eyes with myopic maculopathy of category ≥ 3 according to the International Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia classification had significantly thinner CTs and STs than those with category ≤ 2 (all P ≤ 0.005). In highly myopic eyes, a decrease in the CT and ST was more pronounced in eyes with more structural changes, such as longer axial length, steeper macular curvature, and the presence of posterior staphyloma.\n"

      "METHODS: Observational study. DME patients with HEs were recruited. The HE area and location both by MCI and CFP were measured by ImageJ software. Multivariate regression models were used to analyze the associations of serum lipid levels with the total HE area and HE location.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (74 eyes) were enrolled to quantify HEs in DME.

      "STUDY DESIGN: A validation study using cross-sectional data.\n",
      "METHODS: Seven hundred clinically-diagnosed AMD patients and seven hundred non-AMD individuals were randomly selected from patients at the Kyoto University Hospital's ophthalmology outpatient clinic between January 2011 and December 2017. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative likelihood ratio of eight different claims'-based definitions of AMD for detecting clinically-diagnosed AMD.

The results of color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography, and corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology (Corvis ST tonometry) were reviewed. The association between inter-eye differences in clinical features and MAM grading was analyzed using logistic regression analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 72 eyes of 36 patients 61.0 ± 9.3 years of age, 9, 33, 17, and 13 eyes had A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively. The mean axial length was 30.44 ± 1.92 mm, and there was no significant difference between eyes with less severe and more severe MAM. The inter-eye differences in MAM grading were associated with the inter-eye differences in the presence of Bruch's membrane defects (P = 0.014), ellipsoid zone disruption (P = 0.013), vessel density of the deep retinal layer (P = 0.022), foveal avascular zone circularity (P = 0.012), foveal avascular zone area (P = 0.049), flow area of the choriocapillaris (P = 0.013), vessel diameter (P = 0.045), and fractal dimension (P = 0.015). No Corvis ST parameter was statistically significant. A higher difference in the choriocapillaris flow area (P = 0.013; adjusted odds ratio = 1.10 [1.02-1.18]) remained associated with higher inter-eye differences in MAM grading in the multivariable regression.\n",

      " Long-term progression of myopic maculopathy in degenerative myopia as imaged by SD-OCT and IR imaging.\n",
      "CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians can benefit from developing an understanding of the natural disease progression of myopic maculopathy in degenerative myopia using optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of high myopia is constantly increasing. In this work, infrared imaging and OCT is used to study the natural course of the disease.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a retrospective longitudinal study. Medical records of 72 patients with high myopia (< 6.00 D) and a minimum five-year follow-up period were analysed. Collected data on all enrolled patients included demographic characteristics and medical history, as well as recordings on best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp examination, OCT, and fluorescein angiography in cases of suspected myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Images were independently marked by two graders.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 54.6 ± 14.4 years (59.72% female) with baseline logMAR best-corrected visual acuity of 0.22 ± 0.28. At baseline examination, 70.83% of the study group showed signs of maculopathy and 62.5% diffuse or patchy atrophy. During follow-up, 22.2% of patients with any type of atrophy showed enlarged affected areas. Two patients with baseline lacquer cracks developed new lesions. There was a weak correlation between patient age and maculopathy progression (r = 0.233; p = 0.03). While central retinal thickness was not associated with maculopathy progression (p = 0.203), a moderate correlation was found between choroidal thickness and maculopathy progression (r = -0.516; p < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Lesion characteristics in myopic degeneration have been elucidated, taking advantage of the ongoing technological advances in retinal imaging. The understanding of disease patterns and progression is essential for appropriate management of patients, while discovering biomarkers which lead to choroidal neovascularisation development is of urgent importance to establish international diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols.\n"

      " The role of gap junctions in cell death and neuromodulation in the retina.\n",
      "Vision altering diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, retinal vascular disease, traumatic brain injuries and others cripple many lives and are projected to continue to cause anguish in the foreseeable future. Gap junctions serve as an emerging target for neuromodulation and possible regeneration as they directly connect healthy and/or diseased cells, thereby playing a crucial role in pathophysiology. Since they are permeable for macromolecules, able to cross the cellular barriers, they show duality in illness as a cause and as a therapeutic target. In this review, we take recent advancements in gap junction neuromodulation (pharmacological blockade, gene therapy, electrical and light stimulation) into account, to show the gap junction's role in neuronal cell death and the possible routes of rescuing neuronal and glial cells in the retina succeeding illness or injury.\n",

      " Ferrostatin-1 attenuates ferroptosis and protects the retina against light-induced retinal degeneration.\n",
      "Degenerative retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, are serious diseases that may lead to irreversible retinal neuron damage and permanent vision impairment. There are currently no effective treatments for these diseases due to our incomplete understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms. Ferroptosis, a newly identified iron-dependent mode of cell death, is implicated in various diseases. However, it is unknown whether ferroptosis is involved in light-induced retinal degeneration. In this study, we found that light exposure significantly reduced the viability of photoreceptor cells in vitro and induced pro-ferroptotic changes, including iron accumulation, mitochondrial shrinkage, glutathione depletion, increased malondialdehyde (MDA), and decreased protein expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4. The effects of light exposure on ferroptosis were attenuated by ferrostatin-1. Consistently, the results of in vivo studies demonstrated that ferrostatin-1 protected against light-induced ferroptosis. And it exerted therapeutic effects by inhibiting neuroinflammation and prevented the effects of light exposure on the structure and function of the retina. The findings reveal an important role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of light-induced retinal degeneration and suggest that ferroptosis may be a novel treatment target for preventing retinal degeneration.\n"

      " Prevalence of fundus tessellation and its associated factors in Chinese children and adolescents with high myopia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and associated factors of fundus tessellation in highly myopic children and adolescents.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 513 high myopes (spherical equivalent [SE] ≤ -5.0 D, 4-19 years of age) without any advanced pathological myopic lesions were enrolled. Fundus photographs and choroidal thickness (ChT) data were collected by SS-OCT. A novel grading approach was adopted to classify fundus tessellation into four categories on colour fundus photography, referring to the location of tessellation divided by an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid centred on the fovea, through which closer to the fovea represents higher grades of fundus tessellation. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) area and ovality index were also measured.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the participants, with a mean age of 13.47 ± 3.13 years and mean SE of - 8.34 ± 1.91 D, there were 29 (5.7%), 95 (18.5%), 233 (45.4%) and 156 (30.4%) participants with grade 0 to grade 3 fundus tessellation, respectively. The ChT in both the macular and peripapillary area was negatively correlated with the fundus tessellation grade (R = -0.763 and -0.537, respectively, all p < 0.001). Higher grades of fundus tessellation were independently associated with thinner macular ChT (OR = 1.734, 95% CI: 1.621-1.856, p < 0.001), longer axial length (OR = 1.368, 95% CI: 1.105-1.695, p = 0.004), larger PPA area (OR = 1.391, 95% CI: 1.073-1.802, p = 0.013) and the female sex (OR = 1.605, 95% CI: 1.092-2.359, p = 0.016).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The fundus tessellation grade could reflect the ChT, representing the severity of myopic maculopathy among young high myopes who rarely had any advanced lesions of pathological myopia. Fundus tessellation grade might be a potential index for assessing early-stage myopic maculopathy in children and adolescents.\n",

      " Deep Learning Approach for Automated Detection of Myopic Maculopathy and Pathologic Myopia in Fundus Images.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine whether eyes with pathologic myopia can be identified and whether each type of myopic maculopathy lesion on fundus photographs can be diagnosed by deep learning (DL) algorithms.\n",
      "DESIGN: A DL algorithm was developed to recognize myopic maculopathy features and to categorize the myopic maculopathy automatically.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: We examined 7020 fundus images from 4432 highly myopic eyes obtained from the Advanced Clinical Center for Myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Deep learning (DL) algorithms were developed to recognize the key features of myopic maculopathy with 5176 fundus images. These algorithms were also used to develop a Meta-analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) study categorizing system (CS) by adding a specific processing layer. Models and the system were evaluated by 1844 fundus image. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to determine the performance of each DL algorithm. The rate of correct predictions was used to determine the performance of the META-PM study CS.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four trained DL models were able to recognize the lesions of myopic maculopathy accurately with high sensitivity and specificity. The META-PM study CS also showed a high accuracy and was qualified to be used in a semiautomated way during screening for myopic maculopathy in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "RESULTS: The sensitivity of the DL models was 84.44% for diffuse atrophy, 87.22% for patchy atrophy, 85.10% for macular atrophy, and 37.07% for choroidal neovascularization, and the AUC values were 0.970, 0.978, 0.982, and 0.881, respectively. The rate of total correct predictions from the META-PM study CS was 87.53%, with rates of 90.18%, 95.28%, 97.50%, and 91.14%, respectively, for each type of lesion. The META-PM study CS showed an overall rate of 92.08% in detecting pathologic myopia correctly, which was defined as having myopic maculopathy equal to or more serious than diffuse atrophy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The novel DL models and system can achieve high sensitivity and specificity in identifying the different types of lesions of myopic maculopathy. These results will assist in the screening for pathologic myopia and subsequent protection of patients against low vision and blindness caused by myopic maculopathy.\n"

      " Postoperative outcomes of idiopathic epiretinal membrane associated with foveoschisis.\n",
      "AIMS: To analyse the prevalence and postoperative outcomes of a particular form of epiretinal membrane (ERM) with foveoschisis-like stretched hyporeflective spaces in emmetropic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective study of all consecutive eyes operated for primary ERM over a 46-month period was conducted. The presence of foveoschisis-like stretched hyporeflective spaces was assessed on the preoperative optical coherence tomography B-scan in all eyes. Highly myopic eyes were excluded. Preoperative and postoperative characteristics of eyes with foveoschisis were compared with those of a control group of 100 consecutive eyes with primary ERM without cystoid spaces.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 544 eyes with primary ERM, 17 had foveoschisis, corresponding to a prevalence of 3.1%. After a mean postoperative follow-up of 17.9±10.9 months, the foveoschisis had completely resolved in 76.5% of eyes (n=13/17). In the four eyes (23.5%) with persistent foveoschisis, the remaining hyporeflective cystoid spaces were located exclusively in the inner nuclear layer. The postoperative visual acuity and central macular thickness did not differ between both groups at the final visit. However, an acute postoperative macular oedema occurred in 24% (n=4/17) of cases (vs 3% in the control group; p=0.0084).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Foveoschisis was found in about 3% of eyes with idiopathic ERM. After peeling, the foveoschisis usually resolves completely with functional outcomes similar to those achieved with other primary ERM. However, this feature was associated with a higher risk of postoperative macular oedema (in 1/4 of cases).\n"

      "METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a nationwide database conducted on subjects attending to optometry centers, between January 2013 and December 2019. Fundus photographs were performed by optometrists, using non-mydriatic cameras, and evaluated by a group of 12 retina specialists.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 119,877 subjects included, the overall prevalence of AMD was 7.6%. The prevalence of early, intermediate, and advanced AMD was 2.9%, 2.7%, and 2.0%, respectively. Of the 9129 AMD subjects, 1161 (12.7%) had geographic atrophy, and 1089 (11.9%) had neovascular AMD, either scar (4.5%) or exudative (7.4%). There was a significant association between AMD and age (per year older, adjusted odds ratio, OR 1.116; 95% CI 1.114 to 1.119, p<0.0001). Women had higher prevalence (adjusted OR 1.17; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.23, p<0.0001). Every diopter (spherical equivalent) of progress toward hyperopia was associated with a significant increase in early AMD prevalence (adjusted OR 1.02, 95 CI 1.01 to 1.04, p=0.0074). Presence of diabetes was associated with a lower AMD prevalence (p<0.0001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AMD (any eye and any severity) was 7.6%, with a prevalence of advanced AMD of 2.0%. Older age and women were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of AMD, whereas myopia and presence of diabetes were associated with significantly lower odds of any AMD.\n"

      "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate choroidal arterial watershed zones (CWZ) in highly myopic patients. The relationships between CWZ location and myopic maculopathy location and classification were also examined.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective study included 102 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with myopic maculopathy. Indocyanine green videoangiography was used to evaluate CWZ presence, location, and configuration. Maculopathy signs were used to examine the relationship between CWZ and myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: Various CWZ types were identified in 102 of 158 eyes. The CWZ patterns were classified as vertical optic nerve head (vertical-ONH) in 30 eyes, stellate in 29 eyes, vertical-ONH extending to the macula in 28 eyes, horizontal fovea in eight eyes, and vertical parafovea in seven eyes. Choroidal neovascularization occurred within CWZs in 35 of 42 eyes, and macular atrophy was located within foveal CWZs in 20 of 23 eyes. The CWZ type was significantly correlated with mCNV presence (OR = 5.652, P = 0.014).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Variations in CWZ topography are associated with myopic maculopathy, particularly in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and macular atrophy, and CWZ is a risk factor for mCNV. This suggests that eyes with macular CWZs are vulnerable to developing myopic maculopathy and are predisposed to mCNV because of ischaemic hypoxia.\n",

      "METHODS: An observational retrospective study of treatment-naïve epiretinal membrane and myopic traction maculopathy eyes was conducted to identify biomarkers of a 3 × 3 mm macular region centered on the fovea, using optical coherence tomography angiography.\n",
      "RESULTS: The myopic traction maculopathy and epiretinal membrane groups comprised 27 and 32 eyes, respectively. In the myopic traction maculopathy group, the spherical equivalent was more myopic and the axial length was longer than in the epiretinal membrane group. Myopic traction maculopathy eyes had larger outer and smaller inner retinal volumes, larger area and perimeter of foveal avascular zones, greater circularity of foveal avascular zones, and smaller foveal vessel density in the superficial layer than epiretinal membrane eyes. Internal limiting membrane incompliance and staphyloma were significantly more in the myopic traction maculopathy group than in the epiretinal membrane group.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The intraretinal changes in myopic traction maculopathy eyes compared with epiretinal membrane eyes showed larger avascular zones, which may have been caused by tangential internal limiting membrane incompliance. Anteroposterior traction forces from staphyloma in myopic traction maculopathy eyes may lead to larger outer retinal volumes. In epiretinal membrane eyes, traction forces confined to the superficial retina caused large inner retinal volumes and foveal acircularity.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the anatomical and functional surgical outcomes of eyes affected by myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) with and without an outer lamellar macular hole (O-LMH).\n",
      "METHODS: Forty-eight eyes affected by MTM were included: a study group of 24 eyes with an O-LMH and a control group of 24 eyes without an O-LMH. All patients underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and were staged according to the MTM staging system. The surgical techniques applied were pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), macular buckle (MB), or combined surgery. The follow-up visit was 12 months after the latest intervention.\n",
      "RESULTS: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved significantly in both groups after surgery (p < 0.05). A successful surgical result was obtained in both groups at the final follow-up. In the study group, 3 eyes underwent PPV, 14 eyes underwent MB, and 7 underwent a combined surgery. Six patients developed an iatrogenic full-thickness macular hole (FTMH). In the control group, 5 eyes underwent PPV, 16 underwent MB, and 3 had combined surgery. Four patients developed a FTMH. In both groups, all the eyes with an iatrogenic FTMH received PPV as first surgery (alone or combined). A topographical correspondence between the interruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and the backscattering phenomenon was found on OCT.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The O-LMH is an OCT sign that may occur in eyes affected by MTM. Its presence is correlated with a higher risk of developing an iatrogenic FTMH after PPV (alone or combined) probably due to the thinner residual retinal tissue. Postoperative BCVA is not limited in eyes with an O-LMH and this may be explained by the restoration of the EZ after surgery.\n"

      " Myopic Traction Maculopathy: A New Perspective on Classification and Management.\n",
      "Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) is a complex disease affecting approximately 30% of eyes with pathologic myopia. A review of the history of treatment of MTM with success rates and limitations of different surgical techniques are reported.The pathogenesis, the definition and the management were clarified in a recent study(cit). The MTM Staging System (MSS) table summarizes all the stages of MTM offering insights on the pathogenesis and natural evolution of the disease.Guidelines of management of MTM were therefore proposed, but customized for each stage.Initial stages 1a and 2a, which define maculoschisis in the inner or inner-outer or only outer layers of the retina, should be observed. Stages 3a and 4a, defining macular detachment with and without associated schisis, should be treated with a macular buckle (MB).Stage 1b, which is a lamellar macular hole in a myopic eye, should be treated with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) only in symptomatic cases. Stages 2b, 3b, and 4b should be treated with a MB and PPV should be added in a second step only if the presence of a lamellar macular hole requires intervention to improve visual function.Stage 1c, which is a full thickness macular hole in a myopic eye, should be treated with PPV. Stages 2c, 3c and 4c should be treated with a combination of simultaneous MB + PPV to treat both the retinal pattern of schisis or detachment and the full thickness macular hole.\n",

      " Quantitative OCT angiography of the retinal microvasculature and choriocapillaris in highly myopic eyes with myopic macular degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To quantify retinal and choriocapillaris (CC) microvasculature in highly myopic (HM) eyes with myopic macular degeneration (MMD) using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA).\n",
      "METHODS: 162 HM eyes (spherical equivalent ≤ -6.0 dioptres or axial length (AL) ≥26.5 mm) from 98 participants were enrolled, including 60 eyes (37.0%) with tessellated fundus, 54 eyes (33.3%) with peripapillary diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (PDCA), 27 eyes (16.7%) with macular diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (MDCA) and 21 eyes (13.0%) with patchy or macular atrophy. PLEX Elite 9000 SS-OCTA was performed to obtain perfusion densities (PD) of the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus, and CC signal voids (number, area and density).\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinal PD decreased with increasing severity of MMD. Multivariable analysis showed that after adjustment of age and other factors, retinal PD decreased significantly in eyes with longer AL (β≤-0.51, p<0.001) and with an MMD severity of MDCA or worse (β≤-1.63, p<0.001). Reduced retinal PD were significantly associated with worse vision (β≤-0.01, p≤0.04). In terms of CC signal voids, multivariable analysis showed that longer AL (p<0.001), but not MMD severity (p≥0.12) was significantly associated with CC signal void changes in the earliest stage of MMD.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We demonstrate significant OCTA alterations in the retina and CC in HM eyes with varying severities of MMD. In eyes with early-stage PDCA, lower retinal PD and more extensive CC signal voids are predominantly associated with increasing AL. In contrast, in eyes with MDCA or worse, MMD itself was associated with sparser retinal and CC circulation.\n"

      "METHODS: Prospective interventional case series of eyes undergoing PPV or MB for FTMH and MD.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at postoperative month 24. Other measured outcomes include the initial surgical success rate, macular hole closure rate and the progression of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 53 eyes from 53 participants were included in this study (26 participants receiving MB and 27 participants receiving PPV), and finally 49 eyes from 49 participants (25 participants in the MB group and 24 participants in the PPV group) were analysed. At postoperative month 24, the BCVA had improved significantly in those that underwent either MB (p<0.001) or PPV (p=0.04). The difference between the groups was not significant (p=0.653). The surgical failure rate after the primary treatment was significantly higher in the PPV group than the MB group (25.00% vs 4.00%, respectively; p=0.04). The macular closure rate was higher in the MB group compared with the PPV group, but the difference was not statistically significant (64.00% vs 58.33%, respectively; p=0.45). Myopic maculopathy development may be more severe following PPV than following MB surgery.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients with high myopia obtained anatomical and functional improvements from either MB or PPV. However, MB achieved a significantly higher success rate in retinal reattachment compared with PPV.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Myopic maculopathy and glaucoma belong to the most common causes of irreversible blindness worldwide and, having an ocular axial elongation as one of their main risk factors, can occur together. The detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) in highly myopic eyes is clinically and technically difficult, and there is no information available, neither about the natural course of GON or about the course of GON under intraocular pressure-lowering therapy. We therefore designed this study to explore the natural course of GON in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this single-centred longitudinal registry cohort study, 813 highly myopic individuals will be recruited and undergo detailed ophthalmic examinations. High myopia is defined by a myopic refractive error of ≥-6 D or an axial length of ≥26.5 mm. GON is defined by a glaucomatous appearance of the optic nerve head or glaucomatous visual field (VF) defects. GON progression is defined by either change of the optic disc or VF.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of vision screening for adults has not been well established. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vision-threatening ocular diseases, including glaucoma, among subjects who participated in specific health checkups in Japan.\n",
      "METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1360 individuals who underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations at 16 ophthalmology clinics located in three municipalities. We surveyed the study participants using a questionnaire. The participants also underwent visual acuity and refraction tests, intraocular pressure tests, slit-lamp microscopy, fundus examinations, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and static perimetry.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 63.7 ± 8.7 years (range, 40-74 years). Among the 1360 participants, 168 (12.4%) were diagnosed with glaucoma and 33 (2.4%) with preperimetric glaucoma. Cataracts were seen in 741 participants (54.5%), and 77 (5.7%) were diagnosed with clinically significant cataracts. Retinal diseases included macular degeneration (1.2%), diabetic retinopathy (1.0%), chorioretinal atrophy (0.5%), macular epiretinal membrane (2.9%), branch retinal vein occlusion (0.7%), and others (2.0%). Regarding the type of glaucoma, 93.5% of participants with glaucoma were diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma in a broad sense (81.0% with normal-tension glaucoma and 12.5% with primary open-angle glaucoma). Multivariate analysis showed that male sex, age, systemic comorbidities, and myopia were significant risk factors for open-angle glaucoma.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Many adults with ocular diseases were screened by ophthalmic checkups. The addition of simultaneous ophthalmic checkups to specific health checkups could be an effective measure for the prevention of visual impairment in the older population.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To propose the Myopic Traction Maculopathy (MTM) management Table, based on the MTM Staging System (MSS).\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective review of 157 eyes affected by MTM, operated with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), or macular buckle (MB) or combined surgery (MB + PPV). Each case was classified according to the MSS. Anatomical results were evaluated with OCT at an intermediate follow-up (3-6 months) and at a final follow-up (2-8 years), considering changes both in the foveal and in the retinal pattern. The number and type of operations needed were noted. The surgical complications were reported.\n",
      "RESULTS: Primary surgery was MB for 83 eyes (52%), PPV for 36 (23%) and MB + PPV for 38 (24%). At intermediate follow-up, the retinal pattern was restored in 55.41% and foveal in 42.68%.Further surgery was indicated as PPV in 25.48%, MB in 14.65%. At the final follow-up, the retinal pattern was restored in 96.16% and the foveal pattern in 87.90%.BCVA improved at the final follow-up (\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Both PPV and MB may be used to treat MTM. PPV addresses the changes in the foveal pattern while MB addresses the changes in the retinal pattern. The MTM management table offers a proposal for the choice of type and timing of treatment customized per each stage of MTM.\n"

      " Pathologic myopia: an overview of the current understanding and interventions.\n",
      "Pathologic myopia is a major cause of low vision and blindness worldwide. Its social and economic burden has been demonstrated by epidemiological studies. There have been recent advances in the classification system for myopic maculopathy that enables clinicians to describe different types of lesions, including tessellated fundus, diffuse/patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, lacquer cracks, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and Fuchs' spot, in a standardized format. From a therapeutic point of view, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy has been established as first-line choice for myopic CNV. For myopic retinoschisis and macular holes with/without retinal detachment, pars plana vitrectomy has been generally accepted as an efficient strategy. Studies are being conducted to determine how to avoid the development of a postoperative macular hole and to improve the quality of vision after surgery. In recent years, studies have revealed preventive measures that can be taken against myopia progression, including low-dose atropine eyedrops and contact lens wearing with peripheral myopic defocusing.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence and causes of visual impairment in a group of community people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Northeast China.\n",
      "METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional survey. Patients diagnosed with T2DM residing in 15 communities in Fushun, Northeast China, were enrolled between July 2012 and May 2013. All participants underwent an extensive and standardized eye examination (visual acuity testing, slit-lamp, and fundus examination). Low vision was defined as presenting VA of better-seeing eye <20/60 and ≥20/400, and blindness was defined as VA <20/400, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. The primary causes of blindness and low vision were assessed by senior ophthalmologists.\n",
      "RESULTS: Visual acuity measurements were available for 1998 (89.8%) of 2224 subjects in the study. The prevalence of bilateral blindness and low vision defined was 0.90% and 10.81%. Uncorrected refractive error was the first leading cause of low vision (75.0%) and blindness (38.9%). After correcting the refractive error, the first leading cause of low vision was cataract (44.4%), followed by diabetic retinopathy (29.6%) and myopic maculopathy (18.5%), while the first leading cause of blindness was proliferative DR (45.4%), followed by cataract (36.4%) and myopic maculopathy (18.2%).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested a high prevalence of low vision and blindness in this study cohort. Uncorrected refractive error and cataract remain the leading cause of visual impairment, but the major challenge is the early diagnosis and intervention of diabetic retinopathy to reduce diabetes-related blindness.\n"

      "DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study.\n",
      "METHODS: Six-year follow-up data for 345 patients (620 eyes with AL ≥ 26.5 mm and spherical equivalent [SE] ≤- 8.00 diopters) admitted to the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from 2007 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Main outcome measures were change in AL from baseline, factors associated with AL, categorization of eyes with high myopia, factors associated with incidence of PS, and impact of PS on myopic maculopathy and visual function.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean annual increase in AL was 0.03 mm. Presence of optic nerve disc conus (P = .025), steeper corneal curvature, lower SE, and decreased choroidal thickness (CT) (all P < .001) were associated with increased AL in univariate and multivariate analyses. Younger age (P = .003) and no use of intraocular pressure-lowering medications (P = .046) were associated with increased AL. Eyes with high myopia were categorized using factor analysis as associated with glaucoma, severe pathologic myopia, and mild-to-moderate pathologic myopia. Older age, increased AL, glaucoma, and choroidal thinning (all P ≤ .001) were identified as significant risk factors for the incidence of PS in univariate and/or multivariate analyses. Incidence of PS was a precursor for myopic maculopathy and visual field defects.\n",

      "In this study, the test-retest-reliability as one aspect of reliability of metamorphopsia measurements using a computer-based measuring method was determined in patients with macular diseases. Metamorphopsia amplitude, position, and area were quantified using AMD - A Metamorphopsia Detector software (app4eyes GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) in patients with diabetic, myopic, or uveitic macular edema, intermediate or neovascular age-associated macular degeneration, epiretinal membrane, vitelliform maculopathy, Irvine-Gass syndrome, or macular edema due to venous retinal occlusion. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated in order to determine the repeatability of two repeated measurements and was used as an indicator of the reliability of the measurements. In this study, metamorphopsia measurements were conducted on 36 eyes with macular diseases. Metamorphopsia measurements made using AMD - A Metamorphopsia Detector software were highly reliable and repeatable in patients with maculopathies. The intraclass correlation coefficient of all indices was excellent (0.95 - 0.97). For diseases of the vitreoretinal interface or macular diseases with intra- or subretinal edema, this metamorphopsia measurement represents a supplement for visual function testing in the clinic, as well as in clinical studies.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate histopathologic features of preretinal tissues removed from eyes with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM).\n",
      "METHODS: We retrospectively studied preretinal tissue specimens from eyes with MTM removed during pars plana vitrectomy. A control group of six idiopathic epiretinal membranes was studied for comparison.\n",
      "RESULTS: Six MTM specimens were studied histopathologically. Outer retinal schisis-like thickening was present in 100% of preoperative optical coherence tomography images; four of the six eyes had subfoveal neurosensory retinal detachment. Postoperative optical coherence tomography images demonstrated complete resolution of the schisis-like appearance in all eyes; a full-thickness macular hole occurred in two of the six eyes. Histopathologic examination disclosed fibrocellular tissue that was strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, weak to moderately positive for cytokeratin, and weakly positive for smooth muscle actin and CD68. There were no apparent histopathologic or immunohistochemical differences between preretinal tissues from eyes with MTM and idiopathic epiretinal membranes from control eyes.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The outer retinal schisis-like thickening, commonly associated with subretinal fluid, that characterizes MTM is associated with preretinal tissues that are histopathologically indistinguishable from idiopathic epiretinal membranes. These findings suggest that anteroposterior traction caused by axial elongation rather than a uniquely abnormal cellular process is the etiologic mechanism of MTM.\n"

      "METHODS: Nine hundred and ninety-one patients (1,334 eyes) with MTM, who visited Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 2014 to December 2019, were involved. Myopic traction maculopathy was classified into six grades according to the new classification system: no macular schisis (T0), inner or outer foveoschisis (FS) (T1); inner and outer FS (T2), foveal detachment (T3), full-thickness macular hole (T4), and macular hole retinal detachment (T5).\n",
      "RESULTS: Seven hundred and seventy-eight (58.32%) eyes were in T0, 157 (11.77%) in T1, 177 (13.27%) in T2, 129 (9.67%) in T3, 45 (3.37%) in T4, and 48 (3.67%) in T5. With the severity of MTM, age increased and the best-corrected visual acuity became worse (P < 0.001). However, no significant differences were found on spherical equivalent refraction or axial length among different grades of MTM (P > 0.05). Moreover, significant differences on best-corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent refraction, axial length, and staphyloma rate existed between eyes with inner FS and eyes with outer FS (P < 0.01), but not between eyes with outer FS and eyes with both inner FS and outer FS (P > 0.05). Besides, significant differences were found on spherical equivalent refraction, axial length, and staphyloma rate between full-thickness macular hole with and without macular schisis (P < 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Spherical equivalent refraction and axial length were not correlated with the severity of MTM in this cohort. It might be preferable to categorize eyes with outer FS and eyes with both inner FS and outer FS as a same grade. Potential difference in the pathogenesis between full-thickness macular hole with and without macular schisis might exist.\n"

      "RESULTS: The four patients included in this study had high myopia and nystagmus at presentation. Ocular findings included vitreous syneresis, macular atrophy, macular coloboma, and retinal detachment. One child had iris transillumination defects and an albinotic fundus, initially leading to an erroneous clinical diagnosis of albinism. Electroretinography revealed a marked cone-rod pattern of dysfunction in all four children. Brain imaging demonstrated none to severe occipital pathology. Cutaneous scalp changes were present in three patients. WES analysis, confirmed by Sanger sequencing revealed \n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This report describes variable features in patients with Knobloch syndrome, including marked lack of eye pigment similar to albinism in one child, macular coloboma in two children as well as advanced cone-rod dysfunction in all children. One patient had normal neuroradiologic findings, emphasizing that some affected individuals have isolated ocular disease. Awareness of this syndrome, with its variable phenotype may aid early diagnosis, monitoring for potential complications, and providing appropriate genetic counseling.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the progression of myopic maculopathy and associated factors in highly myopic Chinese children.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective observational case series, biometric fundus features were morphometrically measured on photographs. Myopic maculopathy was defined as recommended by the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 274 children (mean age: 11.7 ± 2.5 years; mean refractive error: -7.66 ± 1.87 diopters [D]) with a mean follow-up of 4.9 ± 1.2 years. Myopic maculopathy progression was detected in 52 eyes (18.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.3-23.7%). In multivariable analysis, myopic maculopathy progression was associated with a decrease in refractive error (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56-0.92; P < 0.001) (i.e., higher myopization) and enlargement of parapapillary gamma zone (OR: 7.68; 95% CI: 1.63-36.2; P = 0.002). Incident peripapillary diffuse choroidal atrophy, noted in 47 of 236 eyes (20.0%; 95% CI: 14.8-25.2%), was correlated with a decrease in refractive error (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54-0.92; P = 0.009) (i.e., higher myopization) and greater gamma zone enlargement (OR: 8.28; 95% CI: 1.33-51.7; P = 0.02).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Myopia in schoolchildren may have a considerable risk of progressing to myopic maculopathy. Enlargement of parapapillary gamma zone was a main independent risk factor.\n"

      " Myopic Traction Maculopathy: Diagnostic and Management Strategies.\n",
      "Pathologic myopia (PM) is an ocular disorder characterized by a spherical equivalent (SE) of more than - 6.0 diopters (D) or by an axial length (AL) of more than 26.5 millimeters (mm). PM is associated with myopic maculopathy (MM). The ATN classification describes all the aspects of MM which regroups atrophic, tractional and neovascular consequences to the sclera, choroid and retina of highly myopic eyes. The advent of OCT allowed to define the ultrastructural characteristics of the tractional changes in MM, described by the term myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). They include foveoschisis/maculoschisis/retinoschisis (FS/MS/RS), retinal/foveal detachment (RD/FD), lamellar macular holes (LMH) and full-thickness macular holes (FTMH) with or without RD (MHRD). The MTM staging system (MSS) describes all foveal and retinal changes related to MTM and their natural history interpreting them as different stages of a single progressive disorder. The management of MTM can be just observation for the earliest cases with good vision or surgery for the severe stages with vision loss. There are two possible surgical approaches: ab externo, that acts on the alteration of the scleral shape and includes posterior scleral reinforcement and macular buckle. Ab interno, that targets the alteration of the foveal profile and consists in pars plana vitrectomy with removal of all the epiretinal tractions, maneuvers on the internal limiting membrane, and the use of intravitreal tamponade and laser. As they target two different sides of the same pathology, the two techniques have to be selected on the base of the MTM stage, single or combined.\n"

      "OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence, ethnic differences and associated risk factors of myopic maculopathy in Han and Uygur adults in Xinjiang, China.\n",
      "DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study with multistage, stratified cluster sampling method was conducted in Xinjiang, China.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4023 Han and Uygur participants aged 40 years and older were eligible for the study.\n",
      "OUTCOME MEASURES: The association between myopic maculopathy and its risk factors was screened using the generalised estimating equation (GEE) model. We also investigated whether ethnic differences exist between Han and Uygur populations affected by myopic maculopathy. Myopic maculopathy was defined in accordance with International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 3044 subjects (5946 eyes) were included in our study (1736 Han and 1308 Uygur individuals). The participants consisted of 1256 (41.3%) men and 1788 (58.7%) women. The average age was 52.2±9.4 years, and the mean spherical equivalent (SE) was -0.18±2.31 dioptre (D). Myopic maculopathy was detected in 198 eyes of 138 participants. The age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy reached 5.8% (95% CI 4.8 to 6.8). In the GEE model, myopic maculopathy was significantly associated with old age (per year; OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.19; p<0.001) and myopic SE (per -1 D; OR: 1.48; 95% CI 1.40 to 1.56; p<0.001). No ethnic differences were detected between Han (98, 5.7%) and Uygur population (40, 3.1%) in terms of the prevalence of myopic maculopathy (OR=0.89; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48; p=0.64). Neither urbanisation (p=0.38) nor the level of education (p=0.92) was associated with myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: A high age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy was observed in Han and Uygur populations in Xinjiang, China. Old age and high degree of myopic refraction were independent risk factors for myopic maculopathy. No ethnic differences were detected in Han and Uygur populations affected by myopic maculopathy.\n",

      " Iris trauma in a highly myopic woman with one functional eye October consultation #1.\n",
      "A 58-year-old highly myopic woman had suffered a windscreen trauma to her left eye during a car accident 40 years earlier. Reportedly, iris tissue was removed in emergency surgery. Her right eye has very poor vision with only hand motion perception due to myopic maculopathy. The myopia of -12 diopters (D) in her left eye is corrected with a hard contact lens, which is well tolerated. With the contact lens and an additional spectacle correction of -1.5 D, visual acuity is 0.5 Jg1. Slitlamp biomicroscopy reveals a lacerated iris with iridodialysis extending along the superior circumference from 8:30 to 4:30 o'clock and a superior-temporal pupil coloboma. The disinserted and contracted iris tissue resides on the anterior lens surface (Figure 1). The residual pupil is slightly decentered inferiorly and still reactive to light. The lens zonular fibers are intact along the full and particularly the superior circumference. Slitlamp illumination reveals grade 2 cataract formation in nucleus center. Intraocular pressure is 12 mm Hg. The central retina shows myopic tabulation with intact macula.During the past 6 months, the patient has been experiencing increasing shortsightedness and light sensitivity, especially outdoors, and desires cataract surgery. Given this is the only eye with reading capacity, which would be your surgical options and preferred approach to treat the cataract and remedy the traumatized iris?\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Stargardt disease (STGD1) is a common recessive hereditary macular dystrophy in early adulthood or childhood, with an estimated prevalence of 1:8000 to 1:10,000. ABCA4 is the causative gene for STGD1. The current study aims at identifying the novel disease-related ABCA4 variants in Han Chinese families with STGD1 using next-generation sequencing (NGS).\n",
      "METHODS: In the present study, 12 unrelated Han Chinese families (19 males and 17 females) with STGD1 were tested by panel-based NGS. In order to capture the coding exons and the untranslated regions (UTRs) plus 30 bp of intronic flanking sequences of 792 genes, which were closely associated with usual ophthalmic genetic disease, we designed a customized panel, namely, Target_Eye_792_V2 chip. STGD1 patients were clinically diagnosed by experienced ophthalmologists. All the detected variants were filtered and analyzed through the public databases and in silico programs to assess potential pathogenicity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-one ABCA4 mutant variants were detected in 12 unrelated Han Chinese families with STGD1, containing 14 missense, three splicing, two frameshift, one small deletion, and one nonsense variants. Base on the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines, 8 likely pathogenic and 13 pathogenic variants were determined. The functional consequences of these mutant variants were predicted through in silico programs. Of the 21 mutant variants in ABCA4, two novel coding variants c.3017G > A and c.5167 T > C and one novel null variant c.3051-1G > A were detected in three unrelated probands.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: By panel-based NGS, 21 ABCA4 variants were confirmed in 12 unrelated Han Chinese families. Among them, 3 novel mutant variants were found, which further expanded the ABCA4 mutation spectrum in STGD1 patients.\n"

      "METHODS: This was a clinic-based study of 16 patients with high myopia (spherical equivalent worse than -6 dioptres or axial length (AL) ≥ 26.5 mm) recruited from the High Myopia clinic of the Singapore National Eye Centre. MMD was graded from fundus photographs according to the Meta-analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification. Severe MMD was defined as META-PM category 3 or 4. AL and logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured. Sera were obtained from subjects and analysed for the presence of ARAs with the western blot technique.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean AL was significantly longer in patients with severe MMD (n = 8) than those without severe MMD (n = 8) (31.50 vs. 28.51, p = 0.005). There was at least one ARA identified in all patients. The most common ARA was anti-carbonic anhydrase II (anti-CAII), present in nine patients (56.3%). Anti-CAII was detected in more patients with severe MMD than those without (75 vs. 37.5%, p = 0.32). LogMar BCVA was also worse in subjects with anti-CAII (0.5 ± 0.38 vs. 0.22 ± 0.08, p = 0.06). The number of ARAs significantly correlated with increasing AL (r = 0.61, p = 0.012).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: ARAs are prevalent in patients with high myopia, and this increases with increasing AL. In particular, anti-CAII antibodies were highly prevalent in patients with severe MMD, suggesting that ARAs may be associated with MMD. Further studies are necessary to confirm these observations in larger cohorts.\n"

      " Individualized Ophthalmic Exoplants by Means of Reverse Engineering and 3D Printing Technologies for Treating High Myopia Complications with Macular Buckles.\n",
      "Myopic macular foveoschisis maculopathy is an eye disease that is treated, in most cases, with surgical intervention, in which a macular buckle is applied to restore eye anatomy and functionality. A macular buckle is a type of exoplant that comes in various designs and sizes. Often, they are difficult to apply or they do not fit properly in the eye geometry since they have a generic form. In this work, the effort to develop the most suitable tailor-made macular buckle for each individual patient for treating myopic traction maculopathy is studied. Pattern recognition techniques are applied to the patient's Computed Tomography (CT) data to develop the exact 3D geometry of the eye. Using this 3D geometry, the trajectory of the buckle is fitted and the buckle is formed, which is then 3D-printed with biocompatible polymer materials. It is expected that the power of technology will be used to activate the most precise approach for each individual patient. Considering the possible complications and technical difficulties of other surgical methods, the customized macular buckle is an appropriate, easy-to-use, and most precise piece of medical equipment for the treatment of myopic traction maculopathy.\n",

      " Morphological Characteristics Predict Postoperative Outcomes After Vitrectomy in Myopic Traction Maculopathy Patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To provide the surgical indication for patients with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) by investigating the postoperative outcomes after vitrectomy among different types of morphological characteristic groups.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that included patients (37 eyes) diagnosed with MTM at a single institution. All 37 eyes from 37 patients with MTMs were classified into three groups: foveal retinoschisis (FS), lamellar macular hole (LMH), and foveal retinal detachment (FRD). The ratios of anatomic recovery, central retinal thickness (CRT), and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were statistically analyzed among the three groups preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after vitrectomy.\n",
      "RESULTS: Anatomical recovery could be found in all patients of the FS group at 6 months postoperatively and in the LMH group at 12 months postoperatively. Only 83.33% patients in the FRD group showed anatomic recovery until 12 months. The time taken for CRT to reduce to 200 µm was gradually increased between the FS, LMH, and FRD groups. Postoperative BCVA was better in the FS group than the LMH and FRD groups (P < .05), but the LMH and FDR groups had no difference (P ≥ .05) at any point. The visual acuity was significantly improved in the FS group (P < .01) and FRD group (P = .018), but not in the LMH group (P = .196) at 12 months postoperatively.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The FS group achieved anatomical recovery in the shortest time and had the best postoperative BCVA. FRD patients could get visual gain but need too much time for the anatomical recovery. LMH patients experienced anatomic success with surgery, but not in BCVA. Early surgery might be considered for eyes at FS prior to the occurrence of LMH or FRD. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2020;51:574-582.].\n"

      "METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of eyes with treatment-naive inflammatory CNV, mCNV, and Type 2 AMD-CNV were collected. Optical coherence tomography images were reviewed to determine the presence of pitchfork sign, pigment epithelial detachment, subretinal fluid (SRF), intraretinal cysts, subretinal hyperreflective material, atrophy, and outer retinal disruption graded 1 to 4. The influence of demographics and underlying etiology on OCT signs was investigated.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-five eyes from 179 patients were enrolled. The mean [SD] age was 36 [±14.4], 62 [±18], and 77 [±8] for the inflammatory CNV, mCNV, and AMD-CNV, respectively (P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that the presence of pitchfork sign was negatively associated with age (P < 0.0001), regardless of underlying disease. By contrast, the SRF, pigment epithelial detachment, intraretinal cysts, and the outer retinal disruption were all positively influenced by age, regardless of gender and underlying disease (all P < 0.01). Logistic regression showed that none of the OCT signs increased the likelihood for diagnosis of inflammatory CNV. By contrast, the absence of SRF was suggestive for mCNVs, and the presence of pigment epithelial detachment and SRF was suggestive for AMD-CNVs.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The age of the patient had a significant effect on the OCT appearance of the CNV, particularly the presence of a pitchfork sign, regardless of the underlying etiology. The absence of SRF was suggestive for a diagnosis of mCNVs. The presence of SRF and pigment epithelial detachment was suggestive for AMD-CNVs.\n"

      " Combining fixation and lateral masking training enhances perceptual learning effects in patients with macular degeneration.\n",
      "Macular degeneration (MD), a retinal disease affecting central vision, represents the leading cause of visual impairment in the Western world, and MD patients face severe limitations in daily activities like reading and face recognition. A common compensation strategy adopted by these patients involves the use of a region in the spared peripheral retina as a new fixation spot and oculomotor reference (preferred retinal locus, or PRL). Still, peripheral vision is characterized by poorer visual acuity, fixation stability, and larger crowding zones that further hinder processes like object recognition, visual search, and reading. Perceptual learning (PL) has been successfully used to improve visual acuity in mild visual conditions (e.g., presbyopia, amblyopia and myopia), but results in MD are less clear, often showing limited generalization of learning, unlike what is observed in a healthy population. A possible reason is the suboptimal fixation in the PRL that might prevent patients from processing the briefly presented training stimuli. Following this hypothesis, we trained five MD patients and four age- and eccentricity-matched controls with a protocol that combined contrast detection and a task previously used to train fixation stability. Results showed transfer of learning to crowding reduction, reading speed, and visual acuity in both MD patients and controls. These results suggest that in the case of central vision loss, PL training might benefit from the integration of oculomotor components to optimize the effect of training and promote transfer of learning to other visual functions.\n",

      " Central scotoma after indocyanine green assisted fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane peeling.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To report a case with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) that underwent fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and developed a central scotoma with a nasal visual field defect postoperatively.\n",
      "OBSERVATIONS: A 63-year-old man diagnosed with foveoschisis and a small outer lamellar macular hole underwent 25-gauge, 3-port pars plana vitrectomy and fovea-sparing ILM peeling using indocyanine green (ICG) staining. One year after the vitrectomy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a resolution of the macular retinoschisis and an intact ellipsoid zone at the fovea. However, macular edema was present over the area of the residual ILM, and the visual acuity had worsened to 20/200. Goldmann perimetry showed a central scotoma and a constriction of the nasal visual field. OCT angiography detected abnormal blood flow in the inner retina corresponding to the area of the residual foveal ILM. The multifocal electroretinograms were reduced in the central area.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that functional abnormalities of the fovea induced by ICG toxicity may have been manifested by a central scotoma. Therefore, surgeons need to consider the toxic effects of dyes such as ICG.\n"

      " Three-dimensional choroidal vessel network quantification using swept source optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "Precise three-dimensional segmentation of choroidal vessels helps us understand the development and progression of multiple ocular diseases, such as agerelated macular degeneration and pathological myopia. Here we propose a novel automatic choroidal vessel segmentation framework for swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) to visualize and quantify three-dimensional choroidal vessel networks. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was delineated from volumetric data and enface frames along the depth were extracted under the RPE. Choroidal vessels on the first enface frame were labeled by adaptive thresholding and each subsequent frame was segmented via segment propagation from the frame above and was in turn used as the reference for the next frame. Choroid boundary was determined by structural similarity index between adjacent frames. The framework was tested on 33 mm SS-OCT volumes acquired by a prototype SS-OCT system (PlexElite 9000, Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, US), and vessel metrics including perfusion density, vessel density and mean vessel diameter were computed. Results from human subjects (N = 8) and non-human primates (N = 6) were summarized.Clinical Relevance- Accurate 3D choroid vessel segmentation can help clinicians better quantify blood perfusion which can lead to improved diagnosis and management of retinal eye diseases.\n",

      " Effect of medically lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma suspects with high myopia (GSHM study): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Currently, whether and when intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medication should be used in glaucoma suspects with high myopia (GSHM) remains unknown. Glaucoma suspects are visual field (VF) defects that cannot be explained by myopic macular changes or other retinal and neurologic conditions. Glaucoma progression is defined by VF deterioration. Here we describe the rationale, design, and methodology of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to evaluate the effects of medically lowering IOP in GSHM (GSHM study).\n",
      "METHODS: The GSHM study is an open-label, single-center, RCT for GSHM. Overall, 264 newly diagnosed participants, aged 35 to 65 years, will be recruited at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, between 2020 and 2021. Participants will be randomly divided into two arms at a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention arm will receive IOP-lowering medication, while participants in the control arm will be followed up without treatment for 36 months or until they reach the end point. Only one eye per participant will be eligible for the study. If both eyes are eligible, the eye with the worse VF will be recruited. The primary outcome is the incidence of glaucoma suspect progression by VF testing over 36 months. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of changes in the optic nerve head morphology including the retinal nerve fiber layer, and retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer loss, progression of myopic maculopathy, visual function loss, and change in the quality of life. Statistical analyses will include baseline characteristics comparison between the intervention and control groups using a two-sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test; generalized linear models with Poisson regression for the primary outcome; Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test for the incidence of the secondary outcome; and longitudinal analyses to assess trends in outcomes across time.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, the GSHM study is the first RCT to investigate the impact of medically lowering IOP in GSHM. The results will have implications for the clinical management of GSHM.\n",

      " Identification of aberrantly expressed circular RNAs in hyperlipidemia-induced retinal vascular dysfunction in mice.\n",
      "Hyperlipidemia-induced retinal vascular dysfunction is a complex pathological process. circRNAs are important regulators of biological processes and disease progression. However, the expression pattern of circRNAs in hyperlipidemia-induced retinal vascular dysfunction remains unclear. Herein, we used a murine model of hyperlipidemia and identified 317 differentially expressed circRNAs between hyperlipidemic retinas and normolipidemic retinas by circRNA microarrays. GO analysis indicated that the host genes of dysregulated circRNAs were targeted to cell differentiation (ontology: biological process), cytoplasm (ontology: cellular component), and protein binding (ontology: molecular function). Pathway analysis revealed that circRNAs-mediated network was mostly enriched in focal adhesion signaling. Notably, circLDB1 was significantly up-regulated in the serum of coronary artery disease patients and aqueous humor of age-related macular degeneration patients. circLDB1 regulated endothelial cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis in vitro. Thus, circRNAs are the promising targets for the prediction and diagnosis of hyperlipidemia-induced vascular diseases.\n",

      " Choroidal Cavitary Disorders.\n",
      "The structure and functions of the choroid have been long acknowledged but the pathophysiology behind various anomalies has been difficult to understand until the advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT). With OCT imaging, choroidal cavitations appear as optically empty spaces between the outer retinal and choroidal layers with attenuation or loss of outer retinal layers. Choroidal cavitations are found in the posterior pole and seen in conditions such as pathologic myopia, north carolina macular dystrophy (NCMD), focal choroidal excavation (FCE), and torpedo maculopathy (TM). To date, these disorders have not been linked. A commonality they all share is malformation of the RPE-photoreceptor-choroid complex. The following report describes the differences and similarities of choroidal cavitation amongst the different retinal disorders and emphasizes the importance of multimodal imaging in the detection and management of potential complications.\n"

      "AIM: To prospectively determine the impact of choroidal thickness (CT) on the myopic maculopathy progression.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational study. In total, 434 participants aged 7-70 years with bilateral high myopia (≤-6 D spherical error, range, -6 to -27.0 D) completed follow-up visits for 2 years. The baseline CT centred on the fovea was measured using a swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT). Myopic maculopathy progression was determined by fundus photography. Logistic model was used to examine the impact of CT at baseline on the myopic maculopathy progression. Likelihood ratio test was adopted for model comparison.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean baseline age, spherical equivalence and subfoveal CT (SFCT) of the participants were 23.2±12.5 years, -10.50±3.18 D and 153.20±72.76 μm, respectively. Over 2-year's follow-up, 74 of 434 eyes (17.1%) had myopic maculopathy progression. Baseline SFCT was thinner in eyes with myopic maculopathy progression than those without (67.26±37.67 μm vs 170.95±65.45 μm; mean difference, 99.31 μm; 95% CI 83.61 to 115.01 μm; p<0.001). The same patterns of differences were observed in 7-18 years, 19-39 years and 40-70 years. In multivariate logistic regression model, SFCT was a significant risk factor (adjusted OR=0.97, p<0.005) when age, gender, axial length and baseline myopic maculopathy category were adjusted for. The addition of SFCT significantly improved the predictive discrimination of myopic maculopathy progression in comparison with that included established risk factors alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.899 vs 0.942, p<0.001).\n",

      " The role of reactive oxygen species in the pathogenesis and treatment of retinal diseases.\n",
      "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) normally play an important physiological role in health regulating cellular processes and signal transduction. The amount of ROS is usually kept in fine balance with the generation of ROS largely being offset by the body's antioxidants. A tipping of this balance has increasingly been recognised as a contributor to human disease. The retina, as a result of its cellular anatomy and physical location, is a potent generator of ROS that has been linked to several major retinal diseases. This review will provide a summary of the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa and retinopathy of prematurity. Therapies aimed at controlling oxidative stress in these diseases are also examined.\n",

      "METHODS: The Scopus database was used to identify the top 100 most-cited ophthalmology articles published in ophthalmology (T100-Eye) and nonophthalmology (T100-General) journals.\n",
      "RESULTS: The T100-Eye articles were published between 1982 and 2015, and T100-General from 1982 to 2017. T100-Eye had higher citations [median (range) = 317 (249-1326)] than T100-General [158 (105-2628)], but T100-General were published in journals with higher impact factor (IF) than T100-Eye (median IF= 5.5 vs 4.4) and produced more landmark papers (3 vs 1 articles that were cited >1000 times). Fifty-five % of T100-Eye were published in 3 journals: Ophthalmology (n = 22), Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (n = 17), and American Journal of Ophthalmology (n = 16). T100-Eye had 88 original research articles and 12 reviews, whereas T100-General had 84 original research and 16 reviews. The most-frequent studied disease categories were myopia (n = 16) and age-related macular degeneration (n = 15) in T100-Eye and diabetic retinopathy (n = 24) and glaucoma (n = 16) in T100-General. Japan and Singapore contributed most to T100-Eye (n = 42, n = 17) and T100-General (n = 36, n = 26) articles. More than 80% and 95% of first and last authors were male in both lists. Emerging research topics were optical coherence tomography in T100-Eye and artificial intelligence in T100-General.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our citation analysis reveals differences in the focus of research topics of top-cited ophthalmology articles published in ophthalmology and nonophthalmology journals in Asia.

      " Slowing the Progression of Myopia in Children with the MiSight Contact Lens: A Narrative Review of the Evidence.\n",
      "Myopia has become a major public health problem in the world due to the increase in its prevalence in the past few decades and due to sight-threatening pathologies associated with high myopia such as cataracts, glaucoma and especially myopic maculopathy. This article is a narrative review of the evidence that currently exists on a contact lenses (CLs) specifically designed to correct myopia and to slow its progression. To contextualise the topic we discuss the different classifications and definitions that have been used for myopia, the current burden of being myopic, and current treatment options to prevent and control its progression. There is evidence that exposure to sunlight reduces the risk of myopia onset and pharmacological treatment with atropine has been shown to be the most effective therapy for controlling its progression, followed by optical interventions such as CL fitting (orthokeratology or CLs specific for myopia control) designed to decrease retinal peripheral hyperopic defocus that seems to be the theory that suggests that axial elongation is driven by this defocus and explains why the eye continues to grow abnormally after emmetropisation and generates myopia. We will especially focus on MiSight CLs. MiSight is a daily replacement soft contact lens that has been clinically proven and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to control the progression of myopia in children. We analyse the optical design of MiSight CLs, as well as the results of the different efficacy and safety studies that led to the approval of the lens by the FDA. We also expose current knowledge gaps, limitations and future directions.\n"

      "METHODS: Individual-level data from 19 885 participants from four population-based studies, and 1379 highly myopic participants (defined as axial length (AL) >26.0 mm) from three clinic-based/school-based studies of the Asian Eye Epidemiology Consortium were pooled. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the meta-analysis for pathologic myopia classification and defined as the presence of diffuse choroidal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, with or without 'plus' lesion (lacquer crack, choroidal neovascularisation or Fuchs' spot). Area under the curve (AUC) evaluation for predictors was performed for the population-based studies.\n",
      "RESULTS: The prevalence of MMD was 0.4%, 0.5%, 1.5% and 5.2% among Asians in rural India, Beijing, Russia and Singapore, respectively. In the population-based studies, older age (per year; OR=1.13), female (OR=2.0), spherical equivalent (SE; per negative diopter; OR=1.7), longer AL (per mm; OR=3.1) and lower education (OR=1.9) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment (all p<0.001). Similarly, in the clinic-based/school-based studies, older age (OR=1.07; p<0.001), female (OR=2.1; p<0.001), longer AL (OR=2.1; p<0.001) and lower education (OR=1.7; p=0.005) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment. SE had the highest AUC of 0.92, followed by AL (AUC=0.87). The combination of SE, age, education and gender had a marginally higher AUC (0.94).\n",

      " CHARACTERISTICS OF PERIPAPILLARY INTRACHOROIDAL CAVITATION IN HIGHLY MYOPIC EYES: The Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center-Brien Holden Vision Institute High Myopia Cohort Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To characterize peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PICC) in highly myopic participants and its associated risk factors.\n",
      "METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional study recruited 890 Chinese participants with bilateral high myopia, defined as ≤-6.00 diopters spherical power. Fundus photography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were used to determine the presence of PICC, defined as a yellow-orange lesion adjacent to the disc border with a corresponding intrachoroidal hyporeflective space.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 890 participants, 884 right eyes were included for analysis. The rate of PICC was 3.6% (32 eyes). Peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation was observed in two eyes without myopic retinal lesions, nine eyes with tessellated fundus only, 16 eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, and five eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy. The most commonly affected area was inferior disc border (87.5%), followed by multiple (9.4%) and superior (3.1%) disc borders. The multiple linear logistic regression model showed that older age, more myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were associated with the presence of PICC.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation was present in 3.6% of highly myopic eyes. It was more common in eyes with a higher myopic maculopathy category. Older age, more myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were risk factors for the presence of PICC.\n"

      "SIGNIFICANCE: There are several isolated reports of systemic medications or medical conditions that can cause acute transient myopic shifts along with other ocular sequelae, but rarely has this been reported for the combination antibiotic sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This case illustrates a rarely seen condition that may result from treatment with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and result in serious, vision-threatening conditions. These can be treated by immediate discontinuation of the drug, steroids, ocular hypertensive medication, and cycloplegia, depending on the circumstances.\n",
      "CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old woman presented complaining of blindness upon waking. She had been experiencing fever, malaise, and significant abdominal pain for weeks. Blood culture revealed infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli for which she was prescribed sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) and trimethoprim (160 mg) twice daily. After a week of treatment, she awoke unable to see. Examination revealed narrowed angles, bilateral 6-D myopic shift, macular folding with scattered microaneurysms, and intraretinal hemorrhages with mild macular edema and field defects. The condition resolved with discontinuation of the drug and use of steroids, ocular hypertensive, and cycloplegic agents. Her visual acuity returned to near normal within 3 days. Resolution of macular edema, field defects, and hemorrhages followed.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: An adverse reaction possibly caused by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is described causing ciliochoroidal effusion resulting in acute myopic shift and other sequelae. Successful treatment is demonstrated, and implications are discussed.\n"

      "AIMS: To investigate the progression pattern of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (DCA) among Chinese participants with high myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a longitudinal, non-interventional study. Participants with high myopia, defined as ≤-6 diopters spherical power, were included and followed up for 4 years, and underwent cycloplegic autorefraction, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and fundus photography examinations. Newly established DCA, enlargement of existing DCA and development of other lesions of myopic maculopathy were regarded as DCA progression.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 484 participants with a mean age of 21.5±12.7 years (range, 6.8-69.7 years), 68 eyes (14.0%) showed DCA progression, with 88 lesion changes. The first appearance of DCA was identified in 21 eyes (23.9%). Of 88 eyes with DCA at baseline, 47 eyes (53.4%) showed progression, with 67 lesion changes, including 45 eyes (67.2%) with enlargement of DCA, 17 (25.3%) with a first appearance of lacquer cracks, 4 (6.0%) with development of patchy chorioretinal atrophy and 1 (1.5%) with increased numbers of lacquer cracks. Longer axial length (p<0.001), baseline DCA (p=0.005) and baseline DCA closer to the fovea (p=0.013) predicted DCA progression. Eyes had poorer BCVA at the follow-up if DCA was enlarging (p<0.001) or DCA was closer to the fovea at baseline (p=0.028) after adjusting for age,gender and cataract.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the participants with DCA had progression over a 4-year follow-up. Enlargement and newly developed DCA were common progression patterns. Larger areas of DCA and foveal involvement with DCA could be indicators of a worse BCVA later.\n"

      " Applications of the Amniotic Membrane in Vitreoretinal Surgery.\n",
      "Recently, the use of the human amniotic membrane (hAM) has been extended to treat retinal disorders, such as macular holes that failed to close and retinal tears. The hAM has demonstrated the induction of a recovery process of the external retinal layers involving the external limiting membrane (ELM) and the ellipsoid zone (EZ). After that, the application of the hAM for retinal pathologies was extended to large macular tears, high myopic retinal detachment associated with MH, paravascular tears, serous macular detachment associated with optic pit, complicated retinal detachment and advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The hAM has shown a potential in repairing retinal tissue through a regeneration process. This review aims to highlight the use of the hAM in various vitreo-retinal surgical fields, and to confront it with other cutting-edge surgical techniques used to treat challenging vitreo-retinal pathologies.\n",

      "AIM: To investigate the affecting factors of parapapillary gamma and delta zones and other fundus morphological features in high myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Seventy high myopia patients were included in this retrospective observational study and 47 patients were female. Patients were divided into three groups: no posterior staphyloma (no PS), PS with myopic traction maculopathy (PS with MTM), and PS without MTM using 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography. MTM patients were further classified into three types [epiretinal membrane, macular hole, and macular retinoschisis (MRS)]. Diameters of the gamma and delta zones were measured among other morphometric variables using fundus photographs.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 70 individuals (127 eyes), the mean age was 57.46±13.56y. In univariate analysis, morphological features changed most dramatically in PS with MTM patients, who had the largest gamma zone diameters, the largest disk-fovea distance (DFD) and disk-fovea angle, and the smallest angle kappa and vertical distance of temporal arterial arcade. However, their horizontal delta zone diameter was smaller than in the patients with PS yet without MTM. In multivariate analysis, with axial length (AL) and age adjusted, the horizontal diameter in the delta zone of the PS without MTM group was still significantly larger than in the PS with MTM group (\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the gamma and delta zones change inconsistently in different stages of high myopia. These changes may be associated with anatomical changes caused by local traction. Factors such as PS, AL and age play an important role. These findings may provide a hint about the pathogenesis of traction in high myopia.\n"

      "INTRODUCTION: Retinal diseases are an emerging cause of visual impairment in the developing world. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence, pattern, and risk factors of retinal diseases in Nepal.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a population-based, cross-sectional study conducted from 2013 to 2015. The sample size was 2100 subjects age 60 years and above from 30 clusters of Bhaktapur district, Nepal. Detailed history, visual acuity, and anterior and posterior segment examinations were performed. Blood sugar and blood pressure were measured.\n",
      "RESULTS: Complete information was available for 1860 (88.57%) subjects. Mean age was 69.64±7.31 years, ranging from 60 to 95 years. The prevalence of any retinal disorder was 52.37% (95% confidence interval (CI): 50.07-54.66%). The prevalence of retinal disorders increased with ageing: 51.26% between 60 and 69 years and 53.05% among those age 80 years and above. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was the most common retinal disease (35.43%), followed by hypertensive retinopathy (4.35%), epiretinal membrane (ERM) (3.66%), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) (2.90%), and diabetic retinopathy (DR) (2.15%). Other rare retinal disorders included myopic fundus (0.86%), chorioretinal scar (0.54%), retinal holes (0.32%), retinitis pigmentosa (0.32%), retinal detachment (0.16%), and coloboma (0.11%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, those with prior cataract surgery (odds ratio (OR), 1.71; 95% CI: 1.32-2.22, p < 0.001) and systemic hypertension (OR, 1.21; 95% CI: 1.001-1.47, p = 0.049) had significantly increased retinal disorders.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Prevalence of retinal disorder was 52.37% at age 60 years and above. AMD, hypertensive retinopathy, ERM, BRVO, and DR were the most common retinal disorders. Retinal disorders increased with ageing. Retinal disorders were found associated with hypertension and prior cataract surgery. Timely screening, control of blood sugar and high blood pressure, and regular eye check-ups could help to save vision from retinal diseases.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: We reviewed our experience in the management of cataract and idiopatic epiretinal membrane surgeries at the Humanitas Research Institute-Milan, Italy- over the past 3 years.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a single center retrospective observational case series of patients that underwent sequential cataract and idiopatic epiretinal membrane (ERM) surgeries from 2012-2015 in Humanitas Research Institute. Full data was obtained for 53 eyes of 57 patients. Patients with ERM secondary to uveitis or trauma or associated with simultaneous retinal detachment were excluded. Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and myopia of more than 6 diopters were exclusion criteria as well.\n",
      "RESULTS: Cataract surgery was not associated with an ERM stage progression at one month follow up, but caused retinal inflammation that resulted in a significant increase in central macular thickness (CMT), macular volume (MV), central macular edema (CME), IS/OS disruption (IS/OS) and neurosensory detachment (NSD). However, there was no significant change in Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We suggest that patients undergoing cataract surgery in the presence of epiretinal membranes need tight follow up to treat and control eventual macular inflammatory changes and eventual prompt vitrectomy if BCVA is threatened.\n"

      " Pre-treatment With Ranibizumab Aggravates PDT Injury and Alleviates Inflammatory Response in Choroid-Retinal Endothelial Cells.\n",
      "Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is the predominant subtype of exudative age-related macular degeneration in Asians. Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) is widely used for PCV treatment, its long-term beneficial effects are unsatisfactory. Accumulating clinical investigations suggest that combined therapy with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) and PDT is superior to PDT monotherapy. However, the optimal time of anti-VEGF before or after PDT remains controversial, hence it needs to further explore the mechanism underlying combined therapy. PDT causes selective damage to endothelial cells, which determines its angio-occlusive efficiency, yet the impact of anti-VEGF on PDT-induced endothelial injury is unclear. Here, we found that pre- compared to post-treatment with anti-VEGF ranibizumab (rani) significantly aggravates PDT injury in the rhesus macaque choroid-retinal endothelial (RF/6A) cell line. PDT activates apoptosis, necroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome in RF/6A cells. Pre-treatment with rani promotes PDT-caused apoptosis via triggering caspase 8-mediated extrinsic apoptosis, and caspase 8 might also play a pivotal role in the rani's function of suppressing PDT-induced necroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our results implicate that pre-treatment with rani may enhance the angio-occlusive efficiency of PDT and alleviate endothelial inflammatory response, which gives it a great advantage over post-treatment.\n"

      " Genetic and environmental factors related to the development of myopic maculopathy in Spanish patients.\n",
      "High myopia and the subsequent degenerative changes of the retina, choroid, and sclera, known as myopic maculopathy (MM), are a serious visual problem in many Asian countries, and are beginning to be so in the south of Europe, especially in the Mediterranean. It is therefore necessary to carry out genetic and environmental studies to determine the possible causes of this disease. This study aims to verify if the genetic factors that have been most related to Asian populations are also associated in two Spanish cohorts. Eight SNPs from six genes (PAX6, SCO2, CCDC102B, BLID, chromosome 15q14, and COL8A1) along with demographic, ophthalmic and environmental factors were analysed in two cohorts from a total of 365 highly myopic subjects and 177 control subjects. The genetic analysis showed that COL8A1 SNP rs13095226 was associated with the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and also seems to play an important role in the increase of axial length. The SNP rs634990 of chromosome 15q14 also showed a significant association with MM, although this was lost after the Bonferroni correction. Additional demographic and environmental factors, namely age, sex, smoking status, and pregnancy history, were also found to be associated with MM and CNV in this population.\n",

Out of 7,328 eligible individuals aged 40 + years, 5,899 (80.5%) individuals participated. MVI was present in 184 (3.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7, 3.6) individuals, MSVI in 182 (3.1%; 95% CI 2.7, 3.5) individuals, and 11 individuals (0.19%; 95% CI 0.008, 0.30) were blind. Causes for MSVI were cataract (n = 109; 59.9%), late stage of age-related macular degeneration (n = 14; 7.7%; geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD in 7 (3.8%) individuals) each), myopic maculopathy (n = 11; 6.0%), glaucoma (n = 9; 4.9%), non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage (n = 5; 2.7%), and diabetic retinopathy (n = 4; 2.2%). Causes for blindness were cataract (n = 3; 27.3%), myopic maculopathy (n = 2; 18.2%), retinal dystrophies (n = 2; 18.2%), glaucoma (n = 1; 9.1%), and corneal scars (n = 1; 9.1%). Higher prevalence of MSVI/blindness was associated with age (P < 0.001; odds ratio (OR)1.10; 95% CI 1.08, 1.12), male gender (P < 0.001; OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.47, 3.66), educational level (P < 0.001; OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.76,0.92), manual grip force (P < 0.001; OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.92, 0.96), diabetes prevalence (P = 0.006; OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.08, 2.56) and axial length (P < 0.001; OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.26,1.62). In this population from Bashkortostan/Russia, prevalence of MVI, MSVI and blindness was 3.1%, 3.1% and 0.19%, respectively.

Included patients were divided into two groups: vitreoretinal interface pathologies group or retinal diseases group. Presence of epiretinal proliferation and its localization within the 9 macular sectors, as defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), were assessed on OCT.\n",
      "RESULTS: 77 eyes from 69 patients demonstrated epiretinal proliferation on OCT. The most frequently involved ETDRS sector was the 1-mm central subfield, followed by inner temporal and inner nasal sectors. Localization of epiretinal proliferation correlated with the presence of any retinal abnormalities in the same quadrant (r = 0.962; P < 0.0001). 31 eyes (40.3%) demonstrated symptomatic vitreoretinal interface pathologies including lamellar macular hole, full-thickness macular hole, epiretinal membrane and history of macular peeling. 46 eyes (59.7%) manifested various retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, refractory macular edema, vein occlusion and high myopia.\n",

      " Build Your Own Eye: A Method for Teaching Ocular Anatomy and Pathophysiology.\n",
      "AUDIENCE: Residents and medical students.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: The eye is a critical, but often neglected, part of medical learning. This team-based learning (TBL) module was developed for emergency medicine residents and medical students; however, is applicable to any learner who should know basic eye anatomy and pathology. Emergency medicine teams, primary care providers, and ophthalmologists are most likely to encounter ocular emergencies.1-3 These emergencies are uncommon but quite dire when they occur and can result in permanent disability and life-changing morbidity.2, 4 It is critical that medical practitioners who are exposed to these types of emergencies are well prepared to evaluate and treat them.To fully understand how pathology affects the eye, it is critical that learners understand the anatomy and physiology of the eye.5, 6 Many diagnoses are associated with specific parts of ocular anatomy;5, 6 therefore, teaching pathology in an anatomy-based lesson will help learners understand the physiology. This lesson teaches learners about physiology and pathology in a systemic, anatomically oriented way.\n",
      "EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: By the end of this session the participant will be able to:Describe basic anatomy of the eye.Build a basic model of the eye.Identify which diseases are associated with which parts of the eye.Identify the pathophysiology behind diseases of the eye.Name correct treatment for each disease.\n",
      "EDUCATIONAL METHODS: The \"build your own eye\" lesson was taught as a classic team-based learning (cTBL) exercise. The modality of TBL with hands-on construction of an eye allow for social learning, competition and spatial learning related to anatomy. The creation of an eye allows residents to fully understand ocular anatomy which is not as evident when a two-dimensional paper image is used. Some learners need tactical stimuli for better understanding. This aspect of the exercise was focused on using alternative modalities to enhance spatial learning. These concepts are reinforced by the GRAT and IRAT portions of the exercise which tend to multiple choice learners. The fill-in the-blank aspect of the exercise requires recall and research to match the three-dimensional eye parts with pathology.\n",
      "RESEARCH METHODS: Learners were given the opportunity to complete an anonymous survey. Verbal feedback was also obtained from learners during the lesson. The survey asked learners questions about the effectiveness and value of the exercise, whether the content was applicable to work in the emergency department, whether this exercise should be kept as a part of the curriculum, and whether there was any practice-changing information. Learners enjoyed the competitive aspects of the exercise and also noted that they felt much more comfortable with ocular anatomy and pathology after the lesson.\n",
      "RESULTS: Learners felt that the ocular team-based learning module was effective in teaching more about the eye in an atypical way. Some learners felt that an explanation in advance of the eye building aspects of the project may have been helpful so they could have brought supplies from home. Other learners felt that they would not have brought supplies from home; thus no explanation was necessary.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Learners seemed to enjoy the experience. The competitive aspects of the TBL, where the eye models were judged for accuracy, creativity, and appearance as well as the correct answers on the worksheet, seemed to enhance learner enjoyment and engagement. Learners felt that enough time was provided for the exercise. While some learners would have preferred an explanation in advance of the project in order to bring supplies from home, others felt that this was not necessary. Educators should determine what would be preferred by their particular learning group for future implementations.\n",

      " Importance of Paravascular Vitreal Adhesions for Development of Myopic Macular Retinoschisis Detected by Ultra-Widefield OCT.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To examine most postequatorial retina in eyes with myopic macular retinoschisis (MRS) by ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and to determine whether paravascular vitreal adhesions play a role in the development of MRS.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective single-center observational case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty highly myopic participants who were older than 50 years with and without an MRS were studied. High myopia was defined as an eye with an axial length of more than 26.5 mm.\n",
      "METHODS: All participants underwent UWF OCT imaging with a scan width of 23 mm and a depth of 5 mm using a prototype swept-source OCT device. The vitreoretinal adhesions to the foveal retina and retinal vessels and paravascular abnormalities, including paravascular retinal cysts, paravascular retinoschisis, and paravascular lamellar holes, were analyzed in the UWF OCT images. The findings in eyes with an MRS were compared with those in eyes without an MRS.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationships between MRS and vitreal adhesions to the retinal vessels or to the fovea were determined.\n",
      "RESULTS: An MRS was found in 49 of the 150 eyes (33%). Vitreal adhesions to the retinal vessels were found more frequently in eyes with an MRS than in eyes without an MRS (63% vs. 44%; P = 0.04). In contrast, the number of eyes with adhesions to the fovea in eyes with an MRS was not significantly different from that in eyes without an MRS (57% vs. 59%). Paravascular lesions, for example, retinal cysts, retinoschisis, and lamellar holes, were more common in eyes with an MRS than in eyes without an MRS (71% vs. 36%, 61% vs. 17 %, and 20% vs. 8% [P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.03], respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of paravascular vitreal adhesions was a significant predictor for MRS development (odds ratio, 2.56; P = 0.02).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Paravascular vitreal adhesions may be related to the development of the different types of paravascular lesions including retinal cysts and retinoschisis, and play a more important role in the development of an MRS than vitreal adhesions to the fovea.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features of simple hemorrhage (SH) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) lesions in pathologic myopia (PM) accompanied with lacquer cracks (LCs).\n",
      "METHODS: Altogether 105 PM subjects were recruited with fifty-eight eyes categorized as group LC + SH and sixty eyes as group LC + mCNV. LCs were categorized into stellate and linear subtypes. Eye fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography were performed. Clinical demographic data, PM maculopathy, peripapillary atrophy, and macular choroidal thickness (mCT) were documented.\n",
      "RESULTS: Significant differences in age, gender, BCVA, and PM atrophies were observed between LC + SH and LC + mCNV groups. The stellate LC was more common in elder subjects with more severe chorioretinal atrophy and thinner mCT compared with linear LCs (P < 0.05). The mCT in group LC + SH was significantly larger than group LC + CNV (P < 0.001), especially in temporal, inferior, and superior locations of macula. The mCT showed correlation with age (P < 0.001)with a decreasing rate of 0.696 μm/year.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: SH tended to initially occur in younger subjects with linear LCs. mCNV was more common in elder subjects with severe chorioretinal atrophy. Stellate LCs were associated with the worse PM lesions.\n"

      " Five-Year Incidence of Myopic Maculopathy in a General Japanese Population: The Hisayama Study.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Myopic maculopathy is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide. Moreover, the burden of myopic maculopathy has been expected to increase owing to the rising prevalence of myopia globally. However, there is limited epidemiologic evidence regarding the incidence of and risk factors for myopic maculopathy. This study from Japan, with a relatively high prevalence of myopia, could provide valuable information related to these issues.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of myopic maculopathy and its risk factors in Hisayama in southwestern Japan.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based prospective cohort study in a Japanese community in Hisayama, Japan. The study included a total of 2164 residents 40 years or older who had no myopic maculopathy at the baseline eye examination in 2012 and underwent follow-up eye examinations in 2017.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of myopic maculopathy. The grades of myopic maculopathy were categorized based on the criteria of the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group classification system.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the study participants was 62.4 (10.9) years, and the proportion of men was 42.5% (920 participants). In the follow-up examination in 2017, 24 patients developed myopic maculopathy. The 5-year cumulative incidence of myopic maculopathy was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6-1.5) overall, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.6-2.2) for men, and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4-1.4) for women. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age (per 1 year; odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11) and longer axial length (per 1 mm; OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.19-3.95) were associated with incident myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Twenty-four study participants (1%) developed myopic maculopathy during the 5-year study period, which is much higher than the rate in a previous study on a Chinese population. We also confirmed that aging and longer axial length were independent and significant risk factors for myopic maculopathy. These findings should be reviewed among various populations in other parts of the world.\n",

      " Progression of myopic maculopathy in a Caucasian cohort of highly myopic patients with long follow-up: a multistate analysis.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the probability of progression of myopic maculopathy according to age.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a longitudinal observational study of single-center retrospective cohort of Caucasian patients formed by 212 consecutive adults with high myopia. Main outcome measures were age, visual acuity (VA), refractive error (RE), follow-up time, and the macular status assessed at least 5 years apart according to the Meta-Analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group. The progression rate was calculated based on per 1000 eyes/year. Multistate models were fitted to identify the predictive factors and to calculate the most probable age of progression onset using the Aalen-Johansen estimator.\n",
      "RESULTS: We studied 220 eyes of 122 Caucasian patients. Mean age was 48.18 ± 14.1, mean follow-up 12.73 ± 5.81 years. One-hundred and fifty-two (69.1%) eyes progressed of category, and 96 (44%) worsened a mean of 0.3 logMAR units during follow-up. The progression rate was 32.21/1000 eyes/year. The probability of progressing increased with age; it was higher in women if there was a family history of myopia, worse VA, higher RE, or wide macular staphyloma. The probability of progressing from category 1 was > 0.6 after 70 years of age; from category 2, it was 0.7 after 70 years; and 0.5 from category 3 after 75 years. If choroidal neovascularization (CNV) appeared, this probability exceeded 0.7 between ages 45 and 55 for all categories.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The progression rate is lower than in a Japanese series. The vision worsened with disease progression, and the probability of both happening increased after the age of 70-75. If CNV appears, the risk of progression is very high at the age of 45-55.\n"

      "PURPOSE: Axial myopia is characterized by a thinning of the choroid. We examined whether the myopic choroidal thinning also includes a thinning of the choriocapillaris.\n",
      "METHODS: Using light microscopy, we measured thickness and density of the choriocapillaris at the posterior pole, posterior pole-equator midpoint (PPEMP), equator and close to the ora serrata on histological sections of 58 enucleated human globes (mean age: 62.4 ± 17.8 years; range: 24-88 years; mean axial length: 27.8 ± 4.0 mm; range: 22.0-37.0 mm).\n",
      "RESULTS: Choriocapillaris thickness decreased (p < 0.001) from the posterior pole (median: 3.9 µm; interquartile range (IQR): 3.3-6.0) to the equator (median: 2.7 µm; IQR: 1.5, 4.2). It was not significantly associated with axial length, neither at the posterior pole (p = 0.25), the PPEMP (p = 0.81), equator (p = 0.80) or ora serrata (p = 0.50). Mean choriocapillaris density decreased from the posterior pole to the equator (198 µm/300 µm; IQR: 152/300, 246/300 versus 156 µm/300 µm; IQR: 72/300, 216/300; p < 0.001). Choriocapillaris density was not significantly associated with axial length (posterior pole: p = 0.07; PPEMP: p = 0.33; equator: p = 0.22; ora serrata: p = 0.36).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The choriocapillaris thickness and density, decreasing from the posterior pole to the fundus periphery, were not significantly associated with axial length. These findings may be of interest for the understanding of high myopia and pathologic myopia.\n"

      "PURPOSE: Stargardt disease (STGD) is the most frequent cause of hereditary macular dystrophy in childhood. Variants in the ABCA4, ELOVL4, PROM1, BEST1, and PRPH2 genes have been detected in patients with autosomal recessive or dominant STGD. This study was aimed at identifying the novel disease-associated variants in Chinese patients with STGD.\n",
      "METHODS: Ten Chinese families and two sporadic cases with STGD (n = 32) were enrolled in the study. All subjects underwent genetic analysis with next-generation sequencing (NGS), which was based on a specially customized capture panel targeting exons and untranslated regions (UTRs) of 792 genes related to common hereditary ophthalmopathy. Variants were analyzed to assess possible pathogenicity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fourteen disease-associated variants of ABCA4 were detected in 9 Chinese families with autosomal recessive STGD, including 11 pathogenic variants and 3 likely pathogenic variants. Variant c.4253 + 4C > T in ABCA4 was identified as one de novo variant. Of the 14 distinct variants in ABCA4, 7 novel variants were found. In addition, one known variant of PROM1, c.1117C > T (p.Arg373Cys), was detected in one family and one sporadic case with autosomal dominant STGD, respectively. One novel missense variant of ELOVL4, c.59A > G (p.Asn20Ser), was found in one sporadic case with autosomal dominant STGD. The potential deleterious effects of these novel variants were confirmed through intensive analysis.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: By panel-based NGS, 8 novel disease-associated variants are identified in two genes responsible for STGD, including ABCA4 and ELOVL4. Our results further extend the mutation spectrum of these two genes in Chinese patients with STGD. One ABCA4 c.4253 + 4C > T variant is identified as a de novo splicing variant.\n"

      "The author describes a customized posterior scleral reinforcement, its manufacturing method, the rationale of its therapeutic effect, and the surgical technique of its implantation. A 54-year-old female patient with a case history of myopic macular hole with retinal detachment and posterior staphyloma, refractory to pars plana vitrectomy and peeling of internal limiting membrane, underwent posterior scleral reinforcement treatment. Retinal reattachment and macular hole closure were obtained. Best corrected visual acuity increased from light perception to 20/160 Snellen. The pars plana vitrectomy is mandatory to remove vitreoretinal tractions and epiretinal membranes; furthermore, the internal limiting membrane peeling makes retina less rigid. However, it may not be sufficient to allow retinal reattachment and it plays no preventive role in limiting posterior staphyloma progression. The rationale of posterior scleral reinforcement is to reduce retinal stretching, to contain posterior staphyloma, and to limit its progression over time.\n",

      "UNLABELLED: PRéCIS:: Creation of a cyclodialysis cleft can be a mechanism of ciliochoroidal detachment (CCD) and associated persistent hypotony after microhook ab interno trabeculotomy (μLOT).\n",
      "AIMS: To report persistent hypotony after μLOT, a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS).\n",
      "SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This observational case series included 4 consecutive cases (3 men, 1 woman; mean age, 48.8±15.1 y) of persistent hypotony that developed after μLOT between May 2015 and March 2018. The patients' data and surgical results were obtained from the medical charts.\n",
      "RESULTS: All patients had open-angle glaucoma (2 juvenile, 1 primary, and 1 pigmentary) and were myopic (axial lengths, >24 mm). Two patients had undergone previous refractive surgery. μLOT alone was performed in 2 cases and combined with cataract surgery in 2 cases. In all cases, hypotony below 5 mm Hg was recorded 1 day postoperatively and sustained. In all cases, ultrasound biomicroscopy showed an annular CCD; communication between the anterior chamber and suprachoroidal space was detected in 3 of 4 cases. The hypotony resolved in 3 of the 4 cases from 2 to 8 months postoperatively, that is, spontaneously in 2 cases (cases 1 and 4) and after sulfur hexafluoride gas injection into the anterior chamber in 1 case (case 2). CCD resolution accompanied remarkedly high intraocular pressure, which required filtration surgeries. The incidence of persistent hypotony was 0.7% (4/547 eyes).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: After MIGS, persistent hypotony because of CCD rarely occurs. Increased uveoscleral outflow because of LOT or creation of a cyclodialysis cleft by traction of the pectinate ligament can be a mechanism of CCD development. Young age and myopia can be risks for cyclodialysis cleft formation and hypotony maculopathy after MIGS.\n"

      " Oculocardiac Reflex During Intravitreal Injection.\n",
      "Oculocardiac reflex (OCR) has been described to occur with mechanical manipulation of the eye, eyelids or orbit. There are no reports in the literature of OCR during intravitreal injection (IVI). This may be due to the fact that heart rate is not monitored during the procedure. We aimed to evaluate OCR during IVI. A total of 532 patients were enrolled in the study at Asociacion para Evitar la Ceguera en Mexico. Mexico City, Mexico. IVI was performed on one eye in every patient with diabetic retinopathy (DR), age related macular degeneration (AMD) or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathological myopia. Heart rate was monitored with a pulse oximeter before, during and after injection. OCR was defined as a 20% decrease or more of basal heart rate. The population enrolled included 270 females and 262 males with mean age of 63.8 years. A decrease in heart rate of 20% or more occurred in 18 patients during IVI (3.3%; 95% confidence interval 1.85% and 4.92%). OCR was asymptomatic in these patients. OCR occurred in 3.3% of our patients during IVI. Hence, OCR must be considered when performing IVI.\n",

      " Bilateral focal choroidal excavations in a patient with Stargardt disease and ocular toxoplasmosis.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Focal choroidal excavation (FCE) is a concavity of the choroid detected on optical coherence tomography (OCT). It is usually idiopathic and the affected eyes are otherwise healthy with near-normal overlying retinal architecture and good visual acuity.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral conforming FCE in the setting of Stargardt disease and inactive ocular toxoplasmosis.\n",
      "CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man with known history of Stargardt disease, healed toxoplasmosis, and high myopia presented to our ophthalmology department for follow-up examination and was found with bilateral FCEs not present in any of his previous examinations.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: FCEs have been reported in the literature in otherwise healthy eyes as well as a broad spectrum of ocular diseases. The case herein reported Stargardt disease, toxoplasmosis, and high myopia all could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of these findings. Further studies are needed to define etiologies as well as clinical significance and course of FCEs.\n"

      " Fovea-Sparing versus Standard Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling for Myopic Traction Maculopathy: A Study of 102 Consecutive Cases.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling (FSIP) and standard ILM peeling for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM).\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 102 eyes of 96 consecutive patients who underwent primary PPV for MTM and were followed up for at least 12 months.\n",
      "METHODS: We compared the outcomes of eyes that underwent vitrectomy with FSIP from October 2012 to March 2017 with those of eyes that underwent vitrectomy with standard ILM peeling from June 2008 to September 2012.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months and the final follow-up visit after surgery, time to MTM resolution, and postoperative complications such as macular hole (MH) formation.\n",
      "RESULTS: There were 26 and 76 eyes in the FSIP and standard ILM peeling groups, respectively. In both groups, the mean visual acuity (VA) at the 12-month follow-up was significantly improved relative to the mean preoperative VA (P < 0.001 for both groups). The preoperative and postoperative BCVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) showed no significant between-group differences (preoperative: 0.60±0.35 in the FSIP group and 0.61±0.39 in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.935; postoperative BCVA: 0.32 ± 0.43 in the FSIP group and 0.37 ± 0.38 in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.281). The mean time to the resolution of foveal retinal detachment and schisis was also comparable between groups (8.9 ± 4.8 months in the FSIP group and 6.9 ± 4.6 months in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.084). None of the eyes in the FSIP group and 6 eyes (8%) in the standard ILM peeling group developed postoperative MH. Consequently, the BCVA at 12 months deteriorated by 3 or more lines for 4 eyes (5%) in the standard ILM peeling group; this deterioration was not observed for any eye in the FSIP group. Risk factors for postoperative MH formation were worse preoperative visual acuity (P = 0.035) and thinner choroidal thickness (P = 0.025).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The visual and anatomic improvements after vitrectomy with FSIP may be comparable to those after vitrectomy with standard ILM peeling, with FSIP showing the ability to prevent postoperative MH formation and a consequent impairment in vision.\n"

      " Treatment effect of posterior scleral reinforcement on controlling myopia progression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: High myopia is a sight-threatening disease that causes axial length elongation and severe complications. Data on the benefits of posterior scleral reinforcement surgery in myopia control have been conflicting. The purpose of this study was to explore the treatment effect and complications of posterior scleral reinforcement in the treatment of myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Articles were retrieved for relevant studies from inception to July 24, 2019, by PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid. Analyses were conducted to compare the treatment effects of controlling spherical equivalent refraction and axial length elongation. The weighted mean difference and Hedges' adjusted g were used to evaluate the treatment effects, with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistic and explored by subgroup analysis. Publication bias was addressed by funnel plots and Egger's test.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 11 articles were included in this meta-analysis. On estimating the treatment effect, the mean differences of myopia progression and axial length changes between surgery and control groups were 0.41 diopters per year (95% CI 0.21 to 0.61; P < .001) and -0.17 mm per year (95% CI -0.22 to -0.11; P < .001). Subgroup analysis showed significant treatment effects of the single wide strip operation. Single-arm meta-analysis showed less annual axial elongation in children subgroup. These results were robust by sensitivity analysis. The incidence of some major complications in the operation group were significantly greater (5.8% vs 2.7% for myopic degeneration; 2.3% vs 1.6% for macular hemorrhage; 0.8% vs 0 for retinal detachment).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Posterior scleral reinforcement may be an effective surgery on controlling myopia progression by slowing both refraction and axial length change. However, frequent surgical complications should be considered. Further well-designed studies are needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy.\n"

      " Characteristics of myopic traction maculopathy in myopic Singaporean adults.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics, risk factors and visual impact of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) among adults with myopia in Singapore.\n",
      "METHODS: We analysed 3316 myopic eyes of adults aged over 40 years who participated in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases-2 study. Detailed questionnaires and ophthalmic examinations were conducted. A total of 2913 myopic eyes of 1639 subjects were graded for MTM by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. MTM is defined as the presence of retinoschisis, lamellar or full-thickness macula hole and foveal retinal detachment. Fundus photographs were graded for myopic macular degeneration (MMD).\n",
      "RESULTS: Of these 2913 myopic eyes, the mean and SD of age was 60.1±8.0 years; the spherical equivalent (SE) was -2.5±2.3 D; and the axial length (AL) was 24.6±1.3 mm. MTM was found in 0.9% of myopic eyes and 7.3% of highly myopic eyes. In the multivariate analysis, myopic SE (p<0.001), longer AL (p<0.001), MMD (p=0.01) and epiretinal traction (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for MTM. MTM was not associated with age (p=0.38). MTM was significantly associated with poorer best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (p<0.01).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based study revealed that MTM was present in 0.9% of myopic eyes and 7.3% of highly myopic eyes. While greater myopic SE, longer AL, MMD and epiretinal traction are risk factors of MTM, age was not related to MTM. MTM has a negative effect on BCVA.\n"

      " Intravitreal Injections in Arc Sterile Setting: Safety Profile after More Than 10,000 Treatments.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To report the occurrence of endophthalmitis and other complications after intravitreal injections (IVIs) in the Arc Sterile setting.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective study that enrolled all patients who underwent IVIs between November 2017 and March 2019, collecting data about the patient's gender and age, type of injected drug, diagnosis, other ocular pathologies, physician and possible occurrence of endophthalmitis, or other complications.\n",
      "RESULTS: Ten thousand and eighty-three IVIs were performed during the study period, involving 2014 eyes of 1,670 patients with an average age of 71.37 ± 11.63 years. The injected drugs included ranibizumab (54.6%), aflibercept (38.0%), dexamethasone (6.7%), pegaptanib (0.3%), bevacizumab (0.4%), and ocriplasmin (0.01%). The diagnosis included neovascular age-related macular degeneration (859), myopic choroidal neovascularization (154), diabetic macular edema (576), retinal vein occlusion (203), and miscellaneus diagnosis (222). No cases of endophthalmitis were recorded. One hundred and sixty-nine cases of ocular hypertension were detected, while the most frequent complication was subconjunctival hemorrhage, identified after 1,180 IVIs. The residents performed over 80% of IVIs, but there was no statistically significant difference in incidence of complications between the residents group and consultants group.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Arc Sterile seems to be a safe setting in which IVIs can be carried out, regarding infective risk, and it is easy to set up compared to operation theatre and useful to improve intravitreal injections governance.\n"

      " Henle fibre layer haemorrhage: clinical features and pathogenesis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical presentation and characteristic imaging features of deep retinal haemorrhages primarily located in the Henle fibre layer (HFL) of the macula. The spectrum of aetiologies and a comprehensive theory of pathogenesis are presented.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicentre case series evaluating eyes with retinal haemorrhage in HFL. Clinical features, underlying aetiology, systemic and ocular risk factors, visual acuity, and multimodal imaging including fundus photography and cross-sectional and en face optical coherence tomography (OCT) are presented.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinal haemorrhages localised to HFL in 33 eyes from 23 patients were secondary to acute blunt trauma to the head (n=2), eye (n=1) and trunk (n=1), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome, n=3), general anaesthesia (n=1), epidural anaesthesia (n=1), hypertension with anaemia (n=1), decompression retinopathy (n=1), postvitrectomy with intraocular gas (n=1), retinal vein occlusion (n=7), myopic degeneration (n=2), macular telangiectasia type 2 (n=1), and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n=1). Defining clinical features included deep retinal haemorrhage with feathery margin and petaloid pattern radiating from the fovea. OCT demonstrated characteristic hyper-reflectivity from the haemorrhage delineated by obliquely oriented fibres in the Henle layer. Spontaneous resolution of HFL haemorrhage occurred after 3 months in 15 patients with follow-up.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The characteristic petaloid-shaped, deep intraretinal haemorrhage with a feathery margin localised to HFL is associated with various disorders. The terminology 'Henle fiber layer hemorrhage (HH)' is proposed to describe the clinical and OCT findings, which may result from abnormal retinal venous pressure from systemic or local retinovascular disorders affecting the deep capillary plexus or from choroidal vascular abnormalities.\n",

      " Posterior staphylomas in non-highly myopic eyes with retinitis pigmentosa.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Our aim was to highlight the presence and the frequency of posterior staphyloma (PS) in non-highly myopic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients and to study the relationship between PS and choroidal thickness (CT).\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study of 77 eyes (39 patients) with RP, axial length inferior to 26 mm and clinically preserved macular area. All patients underwent fundus photography, A- and B-scan ocular ultrasonography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). PS was defined by an outward bowing of the sclera on SS-OCT and B-scans. The relationship between the PS and SS-OCT layers thicknesses was determined.\n",
      "RESULTS: Over 77 RP eyes of 39 patients studied, a PS was identified in 17 eyes (22%) of nine patients. Fifteen eyes had a narrow macular staphyloma (NMS), and two eyes had a wide macular staphyloma (WMS). Mean age in this group was 34.2 years (range 19-53 years), mean axial length was 23.60 ± 0.61 mm and mean CT was 185.7 ± 71 um versus 259.7 um in eyes without PS. The staphyloma edges corresponded to area of outer retina loss on SS-OCT and were larger than the hyperautofluorescent ring on FAF. We found a significant association between PS and CT in our RP patients (p = 0.003). The mean CT was significantly thinner in PS eyes compared to eyes without staphyloma. There was no significant association between PS and with visual acuity, years of progression, retinal thickness nor FAF findings.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: PS was present in 22% of non-highly myopic eyes with RP. Narrow macular staphyloma was the most common type observed in our series. A marked thinning of the choroid was noted in PS eyes when compared to RP eyes without PS, as well as the outer retina degeneration.\n"

      "We report a case of ocular decompression retinopathy (ODR) with macular edema, diagnosed by optical coherence tomography, after a deep sclerectomy (DS) with an intrascleral implant, resolved with medical therapy 6 months later. The medical literature reports that in 14% of patients suffering from ODR, a pars plana vitrectomy was required, and 15% of patients had a poor final visual acuity. An otherwise healthy 75-year-old man with high myopia and a primary open-angle glaucoma, with previous intraocular pressure (IOP) of 24 mm Hg, underwent a DS with intrascleral implant without complications. The patient suffered postoperatively from ODR with macular edema that required medical therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops (Nepafenac® 0.3%) for a period of 6 months. ODR is an infrequent complication that may occur after any surgical or medical procedure that causes a sudden IOP decrease. The presence of macular edema is only reported in 5% of cases and can occur in patients who report a decreased visual acuity, commonly associated with a retinal hemorrhage. We have described a case of ODR with macular edema after DS with intrascleral implant. Although ODR is considered to cause a low level of morbidity, in some patients this may not be the case.\n",

      "METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses of studies published before June 2019 on myopia complications. Odds ratios (OR) per complication and spherical equivalent (SER) degree (low myopia SER < -0.5 to > -3.00 diopter [D]; moderate myopia SER ≤ -3.00 to > -6.00 D; high myopia SER ≤ -6.00 D) were calculated using fixed and random effects models.\n",
      "RESULTS: Low, moderate, and high myopia were all associated with increased risks of MMD (OR, 13.57, 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.18-29.79; OR, 72.74, 95% CI, 33.18-159.48; OR, 845.08, 95% CI, 230.05-3104.34, respectively); RD (OR, 3.15, 95% CI, 1.92-5.17; OR, 8.74, 95% CI, 7.28-10.50; OR, 12.62, 95% CI, 6.65-23.94, respectively); posterior subcapsular cataract (OR, 1.56, 95% CI, 1.32-1.84; OR, 2.55, 95% CI, 1.98-3.28; OR, 4.55, 95% CI, 2.66-7.75, respectively); nuclear cataract (OR, 1.79, 95% CI, 1.08-2.97; OR, 2.39, 95% CI, 1.03-5.55; OR, 2.87, 95% CI, 1.43-5.73, respectively); and OAG (OR, 1.59, 95% CI, 1.33-1.91; OR, 2.92, 95% CI, 1.89-4.52 for low and moderate/high myopia, respectively). The risk of visual impairment was strongly related to longer axial length, higher myopia degree, and age older than 60 years (OR, 1.71, 95% CI, 1.07-2.74; OR, 5.54, 95% CI, 3.12-9.85; and OR, 87.63, 95% CI, 34.50-222.58 for low, moderate, and high myopia in participants aged >60 years, respectively).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Although high myopia carries the highest risk of complications and visual impairment, low and moderate myopia also have considerable risks. These estimates should alert policy makers and health care professionals to make myopia a priority for prevention and treatment.\n"

      "A 70-year-old woman was seen in neuro-ophthalmology consultation for a progressive right esotropia. She had a past medical history of asthma and osteoporosis, and her ocular history was significant for pathological myopia (spherical equivalent of -23.00 D OD and -21.00 D OS), bilateral cataract surgeries, and laser retinopexy for retinal tears. Twenty-five years prior to presentation, she developed binocular horizontal diplopia and was found to have a limitation of abduction to 60% and 80% of normal in the right and left eyes, respectively, by a previous neuro-ophthalmologist. She developed a progressive maculopathy in the right eye secondary to myopia, resulting in the resolution of double vision. The resolution occurred because the double vision was binocular in nature and the loss of vision in her right eye functioned similar to monocular occlusion. However, she noticed that her right eye continued to turn in toward her nose.\n",

Demographic profile: age, gender, occupation, ocular history, visual acuity status, and type of low-vision device (LVD) preferred were documented. The details of LVDs and subsequent improvements were noted.\n",
      "RESULT: Of the 91 patients, 64 (70.3%) were men and 27 (29.7%) were women. Of the cases which were referred, 36.26% had a severe visual impairment (VI), 32.96% had moderate VI, 28.57% had mild VI, and 5.49% had profound VI. The majority of the patients had myopia 57 (62.63%), followed by hyperopia in 25 (27.47%) subjects. The subjects were divided into three groups based on age 40-65 years, 66-75 years, and above 75 years for the analysis of VI. There was a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.01) in near vision with the help of LVDs in all three groups. SEE TV binocular telescope was the most commonly prescribed LVD for viewing distant objects. The most commonly preferred magnifier for near work was half-eye spectacle (56%) followed by stand magnifier (9.9%) and portable video magnifier (9.9%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The use of LVDs can help these patients with ARMD in cases where medical and surgical treatment have no or a limited role in restoring useful vision.\n"

      " Six-Year Changes in Myopic Macular Degeneration in Adults of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To examine the 6-year incidence, progression, associated risk factors, and impact of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in a myopic population in Singapore.\n",
      "METHODS: We examined myopic (spherical equivalent ≤-0.5 diopters) adults (N = 2157 persons and 3661 eyes) who were phakic at baseline and participated in both baseline and 6-year follow-up visits of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study. Eye examinations, including visual acuity, subjective refraction and axial length (AL) measurements, were performed. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the META-PM classification. Vision-related quality of life was assessed with Rasch-transformed scores from reading, mobility, and emotional domains of the Impact of Vision Impairment questionnaire.\n",
      "RESULTS: The 6-year eye-specific incidence of MMD among myopic eyes was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9%-1.6%). Older age, worse spherical equivalent, and longer AL at baseline were associated with MMD incidence (all P < 0.001). The 6-year eye-specific progression of MMD in 288 eyes with baseline MMD was 17.0% (95% CI, 12.6%-21.4%). More severe MMD at baseline, worse spherical equivalent, and longer AL (all P < 0.05) were associated with MMD progression. Patients with Meta-PM categories 3 and 4 had worse best-corrected visual acuity and poorer vision-related quality of life outcomes than those without MMD (all P < 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Over a 6-year period, one in 80 myopic eyes developed MMD and one in six with existing MMD had MMD progression. Myopia severity and AL were strong predictors of MMD development and progression. Eyes with severe MMD were at higher risk of MMD progression than those with less severe MMD, and were associated with poorer visual acuity and vision-related quality of life.\n"

      " Optical coherence tomography angiography in primary eye care.\n",
      "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive imaging modality for assessing the vasculature within ocular structures including the retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve. OCT-A has a wide range of clinical applications in various optometric conditions which have been independently reported in the literature. This paper aims to present a review of the current literature on the clinical application of OCT-A in optometric practice as well as to analyse and evaluate the quality of the available evidence. This review included 78 articles from a literature search conducted on 26 May 2019 across the following databases: Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science. Primary ocular pathologies discussed in this review include glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, acquired and congenital macular dystrophies, epiretinal membrane, retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, choroidal melanoma, uveitis, central serous chorioretinopathy, amblyopia and optic neuropathies. Primary outcome variables included vessel density, foveal avascular zone area and diameter, flow velocity and flow index. This review aims to evaluate the evidence available for OCT-A applications in diagnosis and prognosis of ocular conditions in an optometric setting.\n",

      " The Clinical Features and Genetic Spectrum of a Large Cohort of Chinese Patients With Vitelliform Macular Dystrophies.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To provide the clinical and genetic characteristics of a large cohort of Chinese patients with vitelliform macular dystrophies.\n",
      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred and thirty-four unrelated Chinese patients diagnosed with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD), autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB), or adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) were enrolled. Detailed ophthalmic examinations and genetic testing on vitelliform macular dystrophy-related genes were performed. Genotype and phenotype association were analyzed among different diagnostic groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, 87 BVMD, 30 AVMD, and 17 ARB patients were enrolled in this study. Genetic analysis identified 37 BEST1 mutations in 53 patients with BVMD and ARB. Of these, 5 variants (c.254A>C, c.291C>G, c.722C>G, c.848_850del, c.1740-2A>C) were novel. The variant c.898G>A was a hotspot mutation, which was identified in 13 patients with BVMD and 1 patient with ARB. There were significant differences of ocular biometric parameters among patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, heterozygous mutations, and those without mutations of BEST1. Homozygous or compound heterozygous patients had shortest axial length (AL), shallowest anterior chamber depth (ACD), and highest intraocular pressure (IOP); patients without mutations had longest AL, deepest ACD, and lowest IOP; and heterozygous patients were in between. Moreover, 7 patients harboring heterozygous mutations in BEST1 and 3 patients without BEST1 mutations showed similar clinical appearance to ARB in our cohort.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest sample size study of Chinese vitelliform macular dystrophy patients. Our results indicated that assessment of angle-closure risk is a necessary consideration for all types of BEST1-related vitelliform macular dystrophies. The study expanded both the clinical and genetic findings of 3 common types of vitelliform macular dystrophies in a Chinese population.\n"

      " Pathogenesis and Prevention of Worsening Axial Elongation in Pathological Myopia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This review discusses the etiology and pathogenesis of myopia, prevention of disease progression and worsening axial elongation, and emerging myopia treatment modalities.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Pediatric myopia is a public health concern that impacts young children worldwide and is associated with numerous future ocular diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment and other chorioretinal abnormalities. While the exact mechanism of myopia of the human eye remains obscure, several studies have reported on the role of environmental and genetic factors in the disease development.\n",
      "METHODS: A review of literature was conducted. PubMed and Medline were searched for combinations and derivatives of the keywords including, but not limited to, \"pediatric myopia\", \"axial elongation\", \"scleral remodeling\" or \"atropine.\" The PubMed and Medline database search were performed for randomized control trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses using the same keyword combinations.\n",
      "RESULTS: Studies have reported that detection of genetic correlations and modification of environmental influences may have a significant impact in myopia progression, axial elongation and future myopic ocular complications. The conventional pharmacotherapy of pediatric myopia addresses the improvement in visual acuity and prevention of amblyopia but does not affect axial elongation or myopia progression. Several studies have published varying treatments, including optical, pharmacological and surgical management, which show great promise for a more precise control of myopia and preservation of ocular health.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: Understanding the role of factors influencing the onset and progression of pediatric myopia will facilitate the development of successful treatments, reduction of disease burden, arrest of progression and improvement in future of the management of myopia.\n"

      " Treatment of macular hole retinal detachment with macular plug in highly myopic eyes: three-year results.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term surgical outcomes of macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) following vitrectomy with macular plug in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: Thirty-five cases of highly myopic eyes with MHRD in 35 patients who underwent an initially successful vitrectomy with macular plug and were followed up for at least 3 years were reviewed. The anatomical outcomes were evaluated by fundus examination, fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Myopic features after the surgery were differentiated according to recommendations of the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) Study Group. The best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) before and after surgery were analysed as the functional outcome. Main outcome measures time-course changes in BCVA and complications.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean patient age was 61.0 ± 11.4 years. The follow-up was 45.2 ± 8.6 months (ranged from 36 to 71 months). The mean axial length was 29.3 ± 1.2 mm. All eyes demonstrated attached retina, but 2 eyes (5.7%) developed reopened macular holes until the last follow-up. Complications of postoperative rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were detected in 2 eyes (5.7%) within 1 year and retina reattached after the secondary vitrectomy. Three cases (8.6%) of prolonged subretinal fluid lasting more than 1 year were detected but finally absorbed completely. Comparing 1-3 years postoperatively, myopic features showed significant progression of myopic maculopathy category (p = 0.035). Functionally, significantly improved BCVA could be maintained postoperatively between 6 months and 3 years. However, vision of 14 eyes (40.0%) worsened within 1-3 years postoperatively, and visual deterioration was associated with progression of myopic maculopathy (p = 0.004) and pre-existing disease of glaucoma (p = 0.006).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: A vitrectomy combined with macular plug provided favourable outcomes in the long term, over the ≥3-year follow-up period.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and causes of vision loss in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2015, compared with prior years, and to estimate expected values for 2020.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence of blindness (presenting distance visual acuity <3/60 in the better eye), moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI; presenting distance visual acuity <6/18 but ≥3/60) and mild vision impairment (MVI; presenting distance visual acuity <6/12 and ≥6/18), and also near vision impairment (<N6 or N8 in the presence of ≥6/12 best-corrected distance visual acuity) in SSA for 1990, 2010, 2015 and 2020.In SSA, age-standardised prevalence of blindness, MSVI and MVI in 2015 were 1.03% (80% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.39-1.81), 3.64% (80% UI 1.71-5.94) and 2.94% (80% UI 1.05-5.34), respectively, for male and 1.08% (80% UI 0.40-1.93), 3.84% (80% UI 1.72-6.37) and 3.06% (80% UI 1.07-5.61) for females, constituting a significant decrease since 2010 for both genders. There were an estimated 4.28 million blind individuals and 17.36 million individuals with MSVI; 101.08 million individuals were estimated to have near vision loss due to presbyopia. Cataract was the most common cause of blindness (40.1%), whereas undercorrected refractive error (URE) (48.5%) was the most common cause of MSVI. Sub-Saharan West Africa had the highest proportion of blindness compared with the other SSA subregions.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Cataract and URE, two of the major causes of blindness and vision impairment, are reversible with treatment and thus promising targets to alleviate vision impairment in SSA.\n"

      " Histology of myopic posterior scleral staphylomas.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Since histomorphometric descriptions of posterior scleral staphylomas, although forming a major part of myopic maculopathy, have been scarce so far, we histomorphometrically examined scleral staphylomas in enucleated human eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: Using light microscopy, we histomorphometrically examined sagittal histological sections of human globes enucleated due to malignant choroidal melanomas or secondary angle-closure glaucoma.\n",
      "RESULTS: Out of 246 globes included into the study, posterior scleral staphylomas were detected in 10 eyes (mean length: 31.4 ± 3.0 mm; range: 28.0-37.0 mm). In the staphylomatous region in the study group as compared with the corresponding region of a control group adjusted for age and axial length, scleral thickness was significantly lower (109 ± 25 µm versus 319 ± 161 µm; p = 0.001). The study group in the staphylomatous region as compared to the highly myopic control group in the corresponding region did not differ significantly in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell density (19.6 ± 4.9 cells/300 µm versus 21.1 ± 5.7 cells/300 µm; p = 0.84) and RPE height (8.2 ± 2.8 µm versus 6.1 ± 2.5 µm; p = 0.13), Bruch's membrane (BM) thickness (3.5 ± 1.3 µm versus 4.2 ± 2.3 µm; p = 0.40) and choriocapillaris thickness (5.3 ± 2.8 µm versus 4.4 ± 2.8 µm; p = 0.49) and density (164 ± 99 µm versus 226 ± 38 µm; p = 0.13). All staphylomatous regions showed a localized BM defect.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Marked scleral thinning and spatially correlated BM defects histologically characterized myopic scleral staphylomas, while thickness and density of the choriocapillaris and RPE and BM thickness did not differ significantly between staphylomatous versus non-staphylomatous eyes in the respective regions. These findings support the notion that a locally reduced scleral resistance against a backward pushing BM led to a local scleral outpouching. The outpouching-associated increase in curvature length may stretch BM with the sequel of a localized BM rupture.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in the global population.\n",
      "METHODS: All published literature of population-based studies on MMD prevalence worldwide were searched and only those with clear definitions to diagnose and classify MMD lesions by standardised grading methods were selected. Meta-analysis methods were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of MMD and its 95% CI in a random-effects model. The prevalence of MMD lesions would also be reported, together with the subgroup analysis of age, region and gender. Correlation between MMD prevalence and spherical equivalent levels and axial length were also evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: 12 studies with 58 558 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MMD in the world population was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.3% to 3.3%). In the subgroup analysis, people with the following characteristics were at higher risk of developing MMD: female, urban life, living in Asia, older age, longer axial length and severer myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: MMD is a serious public health concern worldwide, particularly in subjects who are women, subjects living in urban areas, subjects living in Asia, and subjects with longer axial lengths and severer myopia. Further studies from other continents/ethnicities are needed for comprehensive estimates of the prevalence of MMD globally.\n"

      " MicroRNA-29b-3p inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis by targeting VEGFA and PDGFB in retinal microvascular endothelial cells.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Excessive angiogenesis, also known as neovascularization, has considerable pathophysiologic roles in several retinal diseases, including retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and exudative age-related macular degeneration. Accumulated evidence has revealed that miRNAs play important roles in endothelial cell dysfunction and angiogenesis. However, the role of microRNA-29b-3p (miR-29b-3p) in retinal angiogenesis is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether and how miR-29b-3p affects the function of retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs).\n",
      "METHODS: The overexpression and inhibition of miR-29b-3p were achieved by transfecting rat RMECs with an miR-29b-3p mimic and inhibitor, respectively. The proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of RMECs were evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Ki67 staining, western blotting (of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin A2, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1), wound healing test, and tube formation assay. The expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) were examined with quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively.\n",
      "RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-29b-3p statistically significantly inhibited the function of RMECs in cell proliferation and angiogenesis, while inhibition of miR-29b-3p increased the proliferative and angiogenic activities of RMECs. Moreover, VEGFA and PDGFB, as the targets of miR-29b-3p, were statistically significantly downregulated by the miR-29b mimic, whereas the miR-29b-3p inhibitor had the opposite effects.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: miR-29b-3p negatively regulates RMEC proliferation and angiogenesis, at least partly by targeting VEGFA and PDGFB. These data may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treating ocular neovascular diseases.\n"

      " Risk factors for subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularisation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the incidence, clinical features and predictive risk factors of subretinal fibrosis after treatment of active myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n",
      "METHODS: This post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial included a total of 54 patients with active mCNV. The clinical data at baseline, month 3 and month 12 were used. Fundus photography and optical coherence tomography at month 3 were used to determine the presence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy, and its incidence was calculated. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Visual Function Questionnaire-25 score, macular integrity index (MI) and their changes were compared between eyes with and without subretinal fibrosis. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk factors of subretinal fibrosis.\n",
      "RESULTS: Subretinal fibrosis occurred in 22 of 54 eyes with mCNV. Patients with subretinal fibrosis achieved similar BCVA improvement in comparison with those without fibrosis at 3 and 12 months after the treatment; however, they had lower visual acuity, more subfoveal CNV (p=0.002), higher CNV thickness at baseline (p=0.016), larger CNV size (p=0.030), larger leakage area (p=0.021) and higher presence of advanced myopic maculopathy (p=0.035). Age <45 years, BCVA <60 ETDRS letters, and MI index <20 at baseline were the predictors for subretinal fibrosis occurrence in a logistic regression model.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy was 40.7% in eyes with mCNV. Age, baseline BCVA and MI index could serve as predictive risk factors of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF treatment in patients with mCNV.\n"

      " Regression of macular edema with topical brinzolamide and nepafenac alone and identification of a novel gyrate atrophy mutation.\n",
      "Gyrate atrophy is a rare metabolic autosomal recessive disorder caused by ornithine aminotransferase enzyme deficiency that leads to characteristic progressive, degenerative chorioretinal findings. Patients complain mostly of low vision, night blindness, and peripheral vision loss. Posterior subcapsular cataract, myopia, choroid neovascularization, and intraretinal cysts may be accompanying factors related to vision loss. We encountered a patient with vision loss secondary to posterior subcapsular cataract and intraretinal cysts. After treatment with topical brinzolamide and nepafenac (and without any diet mo dification and/or supplementation), we observed 143- and 117-mm macular thickness resolutions with 2 and 1 Snellen lines of visual gain in his right and left eyes, respectively. Also, we detected a novel homozygous mutation in the ornithine aminotransferase gene: c.1253T>C (p.Leu418Pro). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and/or non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can control macular edema in patients with gyrate atrophy-associated intraretinal cysts. The genetic variants may also be a determinant in the responsiveness to the therapy type.\n",

      "METHODS: Observational retrospective case series of patients with sterile endophthalmitis following anti-VEGF intravitreal injections. Clinical data of patients treated with intravitreal anti-VEGFs during one year have been revised. Those who have presented an episode of sterile endophthalmitis are analyzed and their causality and management are studied.\n",
      "RESULTS: Seven patients have had a sterile endophthalmitis onset within 4days after intravitreal injection (aflibercept n=5 and ranibizumab n=2). These patients have some active neovascular condition: age related macular degeneration (n=4), myopic choroidal neovascularization (n=1) or macular edema: diabetic macular edema (n=1), branch retinal vein occlusion (n=1). Shared signs and symptoms included painless vision loss, anterior chamber and vitreous cell and lack of hypopyon. In all patients, visual acuity returned to within one line of baseline acuity.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Differentiating cases of sterile from infectious endophthalmitis may be challenging. It is crucial to differentiate both entities as a good diagnosis determines the visual prognosis.

      "METHODS: Patients with high myopia (≥ - 6D; axial length ≥ 26.5 mm), moderate myopia (≥ - 3D, < - 6D), and age-matched healthy subjects presenting to the Shanghai General Hospital and Doheny-UCLA Eye Centers were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter study. Any subjects with evidence of macular abnormalities suggestive of pathologic myopia were excluded. SS-OCTA at both sites was performed using a Zeiss PLEX Elite instrument with a 6 × 6 mm scan pattern centered on the fovea. Two repeated volume scans were acquired for image averaging. The instrument pre-defined en face slab of the superficial and deep retinal capillary microvasculature was used to isolate and display the superficial and deep retinal capillaries. A slab spanning from 21 to 31 μm deep to the RPE fit line was used to isolate and display the CC. The OCTA images were exported for averaging using Image J. Littmann's method and the Bennett formula were applied to adjust for the impact of magnification in the high and moderate myopia groups. The resultant images were then binarized. Though projection artifact removal software was used, regions below the large superficial retinal vessels were excluded for quantitative analyses of the deep retinal capillary plexus and the CC. Vessel density (VD) and vessel length density (VLD) of the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus (SCP, DCP) and CC flow deficit (FD) were analyzed, quantified, and compared between different groups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-five eyes of 25 patients with high myopia, 25 eyes of 25 patients with moderate myopia, and 25 eyes of 25 normal age-matched controls were included in this study. The VD of the SCP was lower in the high myopia group compared with the emmetropic control groups (p < 0.05), but the VD of the DCP demonstrated no significant difference among the three groups (p > 0.05). The VLDs of the SCP were lower in the high and moderate myopia groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05), while the VLD of the DCP was lower in the high myopia group compared with the moderate myopia and emmetropic control group (p < 0.05). The CC FD% in the high myopia group was significantly greater than both the control and moderate myopia subjects (p < 0.05). Of note, the severity of the CC flow deficit was not correlated with choroidal thickness (p > 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The retinal microvasculature may demonstrate alterations in highly myopia eyes. The CC in macular regions shows greater impairment in eyes with high myopia compared with eyes with lesser degrees of myopia, and these deficits are already present in the absence of features of pathologic or degenerative myopia. The threshold of CC FD leading to myopic maculopathy remains to be defined.\n"

      " Prevalence of Myopic Maculopathy Among Adults in a Russian Population.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Although myopic maculopathy has become a major cause of vision impairment worldwide, few data from Russia and Central Asia on the prevalence of myopic maculopathy have been available.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of myopic maculopathy and its associations with ocular and systemic parameters in a population in Russia.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Ural Eye and Medical Study, a population-based case-control study, was conducted in rural and urban areas in Bashkortostan, Russia, from October 26, 2015, to July 4, 2017. Data analysis was performed from September 13 to September 15, 2019. The Ural Eye and Medical Study included 5899 of 7328 eligible individuals (80.5%) aged 40 years or older.\n",
      "EXPOSURES: A detailed ocular and systemic examination included fundus photography and optic coherence tomography for the assessment of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: The present investigation included 5794 of the 5899 eligible individuals (98.2%; 3277 [56.6%] women; mean [SD] age, 58.9 [10.7] years) with available information about myopic maculopathy. Mean (SD) axial length was 23.3 (1.1) mm (range, 19.78-32.87 mm). Prevalence of any myopic maculopathy was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%); myopic maculopathy stage 2, 0.8% (95% CI, 0.6%-10.0%); stage 3, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%); and stage 4, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%). The prevalence of moderate to severe vision impairment and blindness was 29.8% (14 of 47 participants; 95% CI, 16.2%-43.3%) in stage 2 myopic maculopathy, 57.1% (8 of 14 participants; 95% CI, 27.5%-86.8%) in stage 3, and 100% (13 of 13 participants; 95% CI, 100%-100%) in stage 4. In multivariable analysis, a higher myopic maculopathy prevalence was associated with longer axial length (odds ratio [OR], 4.54; 95% CI, 3.48-5.92; P < .001), older age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .03), and thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001). After exclusion of glaucomatous eyes, the association between myopic maculopathy prevalence and thinner retinal nerve fiber layer remained significant (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001). Myopic maculopathy prevalence was not significantly associated with sex; region of habitation; level of education; ethnicity; prevalence of arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and inflammatory liver disease; hearing loss; depression score; or anxiety score.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this ethnically mixed population from Russia, myopic maculopathy prevalence was mainly associated with elongated axial length and thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, but was not associated with any major internal medical disease, level of education, ethnicity, or sex. Higher myopic maculopathy stage was associated with vision impairment and blindness. In addition to a known association between high axial myopia and glaucoma, myopic maculopathy may be associated with nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To describe the findings and the management of macular hole (MH)-related retinal detachment (RD) in children with Knobloch syndrome.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Patients with Knobloch syndrome who presented with MH-related RD.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with Knobloch syndrome who presented with MH-related RD from January 2012 to December 2018.

      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MH characteristics and surgical anatomical outcome.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 9 eyes of 5 patients (age range 2 months to 5 years; median age 5.5 months). Presenting symptoms were poor fixation and nystagmus. The fellow eye of 1 patient had RD due to peripheral breaks. The MH was clinically visible in 8 eyes and detected only by OCT in 1 eye. The RD was shallow and extended to the anterior equator in 7 eyes and localized to a punched-out atrophic lesion in 1 eye. Seven eyes underwent surgical repair. At the last follow-up examination (follow-up range 11 to 42 months; mean 24 months, standard deviation 11.8 months), retinal reattachment with MH closure was achieved in 5 eyes along with marked improvement in fixation.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Patients with Knobloch syndrome may develop MH-related RD as early as infancy. The condition may be easily overlooked in children but should be suspected in the setting of high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, and encephalocele.\n"

      " Ganglion Cell Complex Analysis in Glaucoma Patients: What Can It Tell Us?\n",
      "Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by a progressive degeneration of retina ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons that precedes functional changes detected on the visual field. The macular ganglion cell complex (GCC), available in commercial Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography, allows the quantification of the innermost retinal layers that are potentially involved in the glaucomatous damage, including the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL), ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers. The average GCC thickness and its related parameters represent a reliable biomarker in detecting preperimetric glaucomatous damage. The most accurate GCC parameters are represented by average and inferior GCC thicknesses, and they can be associated with progressive visual field loss. Although the diagnostic accuracy increases with more severe glaucomatous damage and higher signal strength values, it is not affected by increasing axial length, resulting in a more accurate discrimination of glaucomatous damage in myopic eyes with respect to the traditional RNFL thickness. The analysis of the structure-function relationship revealed a good agreement between the loss in retinal sensitivity and GCC thickness. The use of a 10-2° visual field grid, adjusted for the anatomical RGCs displacement, describes more accurately the relationship between RGCs thickness and visual field sensitivity loss.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To validate the recently developed ATN grading system for myopic maculopathy to classify eyes with pathologic myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Cross-sectional study. A series of consecutive eyes diagnosed with pathologic myopia and signs of myopic maculopathy (grade ≥1 for atrophic, tractional, or neovascular components of the ATN), with a refractive error > -6.0 diopters (D), were included. All patients underwent complete ophthalmological examination including fundus photography and swept-source optical coherence tomography. Six observers graded each eye twice using the ATN system (≥15 days between assessments) based only on the aforementioned data.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixty eyes from 47 patients (61.7% female) were graded. Mean patient age was 63.2 ± 11.7 years. The mean spherical equivalent was -13.8 ± 6.5 D. Mean axial length was 28.6 ± 2.16 mm. Overall, the mean intraobserver agreement (%) for the same image was 92.0%, and the mean interobserver agreement for the second image was 77.5%. The weighted Fleiss k showed excellent correlation (k > 0.8) for the traction and neovascularization components and good correlation (0.75) for atrophy. Interobserver agreement for each of these three components was 95.2%, 98.4%, 95.0%, respectively.\n",

      " Patchy Scotoma Observed in Chorioretinal Patchy Atrophy of Myopic Macular Degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the retinal sensitivity of highly myopic eyes with chorioretinal patchy atrophy (PA) using microperimetry.\n",
      "METHODS: Fifty-two eyes of 32 patients with high myopia were prospectively included. Twenty-two eyes of 16 patients had PA lesions; eyes without PA were analyzed as controls. Testing points on microperimetry in eyes with PA were designated as 3 zones: zone 1 as the PA lesion including its borders; zone 2 including testing points adjoining PA; zone 3 including all other testing points.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the PA group, the mean retinal sensitivity in zone 1 was 2.1 ± 2.8 dB, zone 2 = 8.3 ± 4.3 dB, and zone 3 = 9.4 ± 4.1 dB. Sensitivity in zone 1 was significantly reduced than zones 2 and 3 (P < 0.001). The mean retinal sensitivity in the PA group was lower than controls (6.5 ± 4.3 vs 13.9 ± 4.1 dB, P < 0.001), and combined zone 2 and 3 in the PA group also presented lower retinal sensitivity (8.8 ± 4.0 dB).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with PA generate patchy scotoma in PA lesions and reduced retinal sensitivity in regions beyond atrophic lesion on microperimetry. The presence of PA may be an indicator to reflect both significantly anatomical and functional alterations on myopic macular degeneration.\n",

      " Permanent visual work disabilities: 321 cases review.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Visual diseases are the fifth more frequent cause of labour permanent disability, what represents 4% of the total of them. In order to assess these cases we must take into account on one hand the visual requirements of each profession, and on the other hand the visual functional impairments that the worker is suffering. Special attention must be paid to situations of legal blindness and low vision, as a cause of serious disabilities. Despite the importance of the matter, we have hardly found any reviews about it in the consulted bibliography.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have carried out a retrospective research of 321 disability claims due to ocular causes, assessed at the Ophthalmology Section of the Forensic Medical Clinic of Madrid, in the last 18 years. They account for 3% of the total disability claims raised in our field.\n",
      "RESULTS: The most frequent professions involved have been administrative services, construction, hotel workers, cleaning and professional drivers. In 90% of cases these professional activities had medium or low visual requirements. The plaintiff in 40% of cases was unemployed. The most frequent visual pathologies we found out were myopic complications (especially myopic maculopathy) 17%, and eye trauma (16%). To a lesser extent: retinal detachment (12%), optic neuritis (7%), glaucoma (6%), diabetic retinopathy (6%), pigmentary retinitis (4%), non-myopic maculopathies (2%) and melanomas (2%). In 23% of cases no significant visual limitation was found (it was lower than 33%). Out of these, 9% were diagnosed as NOVL (non-organic visual loss), 3% of them being very obvious cases of simulation.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In 82% of the cases the expert's report pointed out a significant global (visual and non-visual) functional limitation (greater than 33%) of their work capacity. In the previous administrative phase of all these cases the recognition fo disability had not been granted. From the results obtained it turns out the importance of an ophthalmologist acting as an expert in this type of demands.\n"

      " [Optical Coherence Tomography in Glaucomas: Tips and Tricks].\n",
      "High-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) with spectral-domain or swept-source techniques has become a mainstay in glaucoma and progression diagnosis. Imaging and morphometry of ganglion cell (GCL) and retinal nerve fiber (RNF) layer thickness and Bruch's membrane based minimum neuroretinal rim width (BMO-MRW) measurement allow the detection of pathologic changes. Graphic display of these measurements facilitate a comparison with normative data. False positive (red disease) and false negative (green disease) results represent pitfalls in OCT diagnosis. Pathologies of the posterior pole either caused by glaucoma or non-glaucoma associated changes of optic disc and retina play an important role. Epiretinal gliosis, age related macular degeneration and cystoid retinal changes cause measuring artefacts. A careful inspection of OCT B-scans is mandatory to detect these changes. Highly myopic eyes, underrepresented in normative databases cause changes resembling glaucoma and challenge the OCT glaucoma diagnosis. Neurological diseases present an important differential diagnosis when atrophy of neuroretinal tissue and ganglion cells occur. The location of the atrophy and the relationship of GCL, RNF and BMO-MRW changes may help in differential diagnosis. Sensory tests and imaging of the brain are mandatory in these cases. Drusen and disc edema cause thickening of BMO-MRW and may be followed by loss of RNF and GCL. Again a close observation of OCT B-scans and fundus may help to find the correct diagnosis. Good image quality, knowledge of OCT pathologies and technique of OCT imaging may help to avoid pitfalls in OCT glaucoma diagnosis.\n"

      " Clinical and angiographic characterization of choroidal neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To report the clinical and angiographic characteristics of choroidal neovascularization in patients with diabetic retinopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus with presence of choroidal neovascularization in at least one eye were retrospectively analyzed. The study eyes were divided into three groups based on presence (active or scarred) or absence of choroidal neovascularization (fellow eyes). Imaging characteristics of active choroidal neovascularization were recorded using optical coherence tomography, fluorescein, and indocyanine angiography. Central macular thickness, subfoveal choroidal thickness, and large choroidal vessel layer thickness were compared at baseline and final visit.\n",
      "RESULTS: Our study reports the prevalence rate of choroidal neovascularization in eyes with diabetic retinopathy (0.27%; 36 out of 13,382 eyes). A total of 64 eyes of 32 patients (age, mean ± standard deviation: 68.5 ± 9.3 years) with baseline visual acuity of 0.69 ± 0.69 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (Snellen equivalent 20/100) were included. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (57 eyes) comprised the majority followed by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (7 eyes). Eyes with choroidal neovascularization (36, 56.25%) included both active (25) and scarred (11) choroidal neovascularization, with bilateral choroidal neovascularization in 4 patients. Type 1 choroidal neovascularization was the most common subtype of choroidal neovascularization on optical coherence tomography. Common etiologies for active choroidal neovascularization included age-related macular degeneration (3; 12%), myopia (1; 4%), and inflammatory choroidal neovascularization secondary to chorioretinitis (1; 4%). In the remaining 20 eyes, choroidal neovascularization formation was primarily due to diabetic choroidopathy.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The prevalence of choroidal neovascularization in eyes with diabetic retinopathy is very low, with a lower prevalence of age-related macular degeneration. Diabetic choroidopathy plays a significant role in formation of choroidal neovascularization in eyes with diabetic retinopathy.\n",

      "METHODS: The retrospective observational case series study included 185 highly myopic eyes of 100 consecutive patients younger than 20 years, who were compared with highly myopic patients with DSMs, aged 20+ years and examined in previous studies.\n",
      "RESULTS: Seventeen (9.2%) eyes of the highly myopic young patients showed macular elevations all of which ran only in the horizontal direction across the vertical optical coherence tomographic section fulfilled the definition of a ridge and did not show any staphylomas or any macular Bruch membrane defects. By contrast, in the older patients with DSMs, the DSMs were significantly higher and had a narrower base than the ridges in the young patients, and showed macular Bruch membrane defects in their vicinity, with the axial length being significantly longer, the myopic maculopathy more severe, and the subfoveal choroid thinner.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Macular elevations detected in children and adolescents are usually ridge-shaped maculas and do not have the characteristics of DSMs. In comparison with DSMs, ridge-shaped maculas do not show a spatial association with macular Bruch membrane defects or posterior staphylomas and have a wider basis and smoother elevation slope. As a hypothesis, ridge-shaped maculas may be due to a folding of Bruch membrane at the posterior pole, potentially caused by an asymmetrical enlargement of Bruch membrane in the equatorial region.\n"

      "METHODS: At the DC of Pescara (central Italy), for 3,859 eyes of 1,930 consecutive patients having not undergone fundus examination in the last year, two mydriatic fundus digital images, taken with a CenterVue DRS Digital Retinal Camera, were sent along with Best Corrected Visual Acuity, on a \"store-and-forward\" basis, to an ophthalmologist trained in DR screening, and graded according to the UK Diabetic Eye Screening Programme. Incidental fundus abnormalities other than DR were reported.\n",
      "RESULTS: No adverse event to mydriasis was reported. One hundred and eighty eyes (4.66%) were ungradable. Among the 3,679 gradable ones, 1,105 (30.04%) showed different degrees of DR (R1 to R3), and 126 (3.42%) maculopathy (M1). Any Age-Related Macular Degeneration was present in 387 eyes (10.52%), any optic disc and parapapillary area features suspect for glaucoma in 562 eyes (15.27%), any hypertensive retinopathy in 1,263 eyes (34.33%), vitreoretinal interface disease in 252 eyes (6.84%), myopic choroidopathy in 92 eyes (2.50%), disc pallor in 31 eyes (0.84%). Mean time was 5 min for screening, 2 min for grading.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Teleretinography is a well-established, cost-effective procedure in DR screening. Along with increased attendance, locating a digital camera in a DC with a retina-specialist grader results in finding fundus pathologies also beyond DR, very similarly to fundus examination in an outpatient ophthalmic setting.\n"

      " A review on the epidemiology of myopia in school children worldwide.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Due to high prevalence myopia has gained importance in epidemiological studies. Children with early onset are at particular risk of complications associated with myopia, as progression over time might result in high myopia and myopic macular degeneration. Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the increasing prevalence of myopia. The aim of this study is to review the current literature on epidemiology and risk factors for myopia in school children (aged 6-19 years) around the world.\n",
      "MAIN BODY: PubMed and Medline were searched for the following keywords: prevalence, incidence, myopia, refractive error, risk factors, children and visual impairment. English language articles published between Jan 2013 and Mar 2019 were included in the study. Studies were critically reviewed for study methodology and robustness of data. Eighty studies were included in this literature review. Myopia prevalence remains higher in Asia (60%) compared with Europe (40%) using cycloplegic refraction examinations. Studies reporting on non-cycloplegic measurements show exceptionally high myopia prevalence rates in school children in East Asia (73%), and high rates in North America (42%). Low prevalence under 10% was described in African and South American children. In recent studies, risk factors for myopia in schoolchildren included low outdoor time and near work, dim light exposure, the use of LED lamps for homework, low sleeping hours, reading distance less than 25 cm and living in an urban environment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Low levels of outdoor activity and near work are well-established risk factors for myopia; this review provides evidence on additional environmental risk factors. New epidemiological studies should be carried out on implementation of public health strategies to tackle and avoid myopia. As the myopia prevalence rates in non-cycloplegic studies are overestimated, we recommend considering only cycloplegic measurements.\n"

      " Non-invasive current stimulation in vision recovery: a review of the literature.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Around 253 million people worldwide suffer from irreversible visual damage. Numerous studies have been carried out in order to unveil the effects of electrical stimulation (ES) as a useful tool for rehabilitation for different visual conditions and pathologies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to 1) examine the current evidence of ES efficacy for the treatment of visual pathologies and 2) define the corresponding degree of the recommendation of different ES techniques.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE and Cochrane Library database to collect documents published between 2000 and 2018. For each study, Level of Evidence of Effectiveness of ES as well as the Class of Quality for the treatment of different visual pathologies were determined.\n",
      "RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles were included. Studies were grouped according to the pathology treated and the type of stimulation administered. The first group included studies treating pre-chiasmatic pathologies (age-related macular degeneration, macular dystrophy, retinal artery occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, optic nerve damage, and optic neuropathy) using pre-chiasmatic stimulation; the second group included studies treating both pre-chiasmatic pathologies (amblyopia, myopia) and post-chiasmatic pathologies or brain conditions (hemianopsia, brain trauma) by means of post-chiasmatic stimulation. In the first group, repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) reached level A recommendation, and transcorneal electrical stimulation (tcES) reached level B. In the second group, both high-frequency random noise stimulation (hf-RNS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reached level C recommendation.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Study's findings suggest conclusive evidence for rtACS treatment. For other protocols results are promising but not conclusive since the examined studies assessed different stimulation parameters and endpoints. A comparison of the effects of different combinations of these variables still lacks in the literature. Further studies are needed to optimize existing protocols and determine if different protocols are needed for different diseases.\n"

      " The Inhibitory Effects of Gold Nanoparticles on VEGF-A-Induced Cell Migration in Choroid-Retina Endothelial Cells.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is upregulated by hypoxia and is a crucial stimulator for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration and pathologic myopia, as well as retinal neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Retinal and choroidal endothelial cells play key roles in the development of retinal and CNV, and subsequent fibrosis. At present, the effects of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the VEGF-induced choroid-retina endothelial (RF/6A) cells are still unknown. In our study, we investigated the effects of AuNPs on RF/6A cell viabilities and cell adhesion to fibronectin, a major ECM protein of fibrovascular membrane. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of AuNPs on RF/6A cell migration induced by VEGF and its signaling were studied.\n",
      "METHODS: The cell viability assay was used to determine the viability of cells treated with AuNPs. The migration of RF/6A cells was assessed by the Transwell migration assay. The cell adhesion to fibronectin was examined by an adhesion assay. The VEGF-induced signaling pathways were determined by western blotting.\n",
      "RESULTS: The 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay revealed no cytotoxicity of AuNPs on RF/6A cells. AuNPs inhibited VEGF-induced RF/6A cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner but showed no significant effects on RF/6A cell adhesion to fibronectin. Inhibitory effects of AuNPs on VEGF-induced Akt/eNOS were found.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AuNPs are an effective inhibitor of VEGF-induced RF/6A cell migration through the Akt/eNOS pathways, but they have no effects on their cell viabilities and cell adhesion to fibronectin.\n"

      " Efficacy of toric intraocular lens implantation with high corneal astigmatism within the United Kingdom's National Health Service.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of toric intraocular lens (TIOL) implantation in cataract surgery patients with high levels of pre-operative corneal astigmatism and ocular co-morbidities in a state funded, National Health Service (NHS) hospital.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective cohort study involving consecutive cases of TIOL implantation in cataract surgery with over 3.00DC of pre-operative corneal astigmatism. Subjects were implanted with the Tecnis TIOL (Abbot Medical Optics) with capsular tension ring stabilisation using the Callisto system (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Visual acuity and refraction were assessed at 4-6 weeks post-operatively. Vector analysis was used to calculate the intended refractive correction, surgically induced refractive correction (SIRC), correction ratio (CR), error of magnitude (EM) and error vector (EV).\n",
      "RESULTS: Sixty-six eyes of forty-seven subjects aged 73.8 ± 11.9 were included. Eyes with ocular co-morbidities included dry age-related macular degeneration (n = 13), amblyopia (n = 7), high myopia (n = 7), glaucoma (n = 6), previous corneal transplantation (n = 2), nanophthalmos (n = 2) and corneal scarring (n = 1). Pre-operative corneal astigmatism was 4.25 ± 1.69DC (range 3.00-12.00), post-operative refractive astigmatism was 1.31 ± 1.05DC (range 0.00-6.50DC) and post-operative unaided visual acuity was 0.25 ± 0.19 LogMAR. Vector analysis demonstrated an SIRC of 4.08 ± 1.39DC, CR = 1.1 ± 0.3, EM -0.4 ± 1.0 and EV of 1.23 ± 0.72.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the efficacy of TIOL implantation in patients with high corneal astigmatism and provide strong evidence advocating their use in cataract surgery within a state funded hospital eye service. Refractive astigmatism was significantly lower than the pre-operative corneal astigmatism and a low error vector was achieved relative to the magnitude of correction.\n",

      "AIMS: To determine the prevalence of myopic maculopathy in the general population in Germany and to analyse potential associations with ocular and systemic factors.\n",
      "DESIGN: The Gutenberg Health Study is a population-based study, including 15 010 participants aged 35-74 years.\n",
      "METHODS: Myopic maculopathy was graded in phakic eyes with spherical equivalent ≤-6 D by assessing fundus photographs according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM). 801 eyes of 519 participants (mean age 51.0±0.77 years) met the conditions and had gradable fundus photographs. Age-specific prevalence estimates were computed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess associated factors with myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: Myopic maculopathy was present in 10.3% (95% CI 7.9 to 13.3) study participants. The prevalence was 8.6% (95% CI 6.1% to 11.9%) in the 397 right eyes and 8.7% (95% CI 6.2% to 12.0%) in the 404 left eyes. The most common type of pathology was diffuse atrophy (8.1%), followed by patchy atrophy (1.3%) and macular atrophy (0.5%); plus lesions were present in 3% (right eyes). Age (OR 1.07 per year, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11, p<0.001), higher myopic refractive error (p<0.001), and male gender (p=0.02) were associated with myopic maculopathy, while cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic factors were not.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of myopic maculopathy in the German population was 0.5%, and 10% in high myopic participants, aged 35-74 years. These population-based data are the first in Europe. Myopic maculopathy was related to severity of myopic refractive error and age.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To determine the incidence and long-term outcome of macular atrophy (MA) after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in pathologic myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Highly myopic patients who underwent PPV for myopic traction maculopathy and macular hole retinal detachment at Tokyo Medical and Dental University between 2012 and 2016 were studied. Fundus photographs and/or optical coherence tomography were examined before and after PPV at every visit.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 133 eyes were followed for 39 months with the mean age of 62.8 years and the mean axial length of 30.0 mm. Postoperatively, 14 eyes (10.5%) developed fovea-centered MA, observed initially as a small, isolated, whitish lesion at the center of fovea at 3.5 months after PPV. The appearance of the MA was distinctly different from the choroidal neovascularization-related MA or patchy atrophy-related MA. With time, the lesions enlarged circumferentially. In these 14 eyes, the final best-corrected visual acuity was worse than the baseline, although the difference was not significant. The occurrence of MA was significantly associated with the preoperative foveal status.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The development of MA can occur in 11% of highly myopic eyes after PPV for myopic traction maculopathy and macular hole retinal detachment. This postoperative MA might be a new complication of pathologic myopia.\n"

      " Deep Phenotyping of PDE6C-Associated Achromatopsia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To perform deep phenotyping of subjects with PDE6C achromatopsia and examine disease natural history.\n",
      "METHODS: Eight subjects with disease-causing variants in PDE6C were assessed in detail, including clinical phenotype, best-corrected visual acuity, fundus autofluorescence, and optical coherence tomography. Six subjects also had confocal and nonconfocal adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy, axial length, international standard pattern and full-field electroretinography (ERG), short-wavelength flash (S-cone) ERGs, and color vision testing.\n",
      "RESULTS: All subjects presented with early-onset nystagmus, decreased best-corrected visual acuity, light sensitivity, and severe color vision loss, and five of them had high myopia. We identified three novel disease-causing variants and provide phenotype data associated with nine variants for the first time. No subjects had foveal hypoplasia or residual ellipsoid zone (EZ) at the foveal center; one had an absent EZ, three had a hyporeflective zone, and four had outer retinal atrophy. The mean width of the central EZ lesion on optical coherence tomography at baseline was 1923 μm. The mean annual increase in EZ lesion size was 48.3 μm. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a central hypoautofluorescence with a surrounding ring of increased signal (n = 5). The mean hypoautofluorescent area at baseline was 3.33 mm2 and increased in size by a mean of 0.13 mm2/year. Nonconfocal adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy revealed residual foveal cones in only one of two cases. Full-field ERGs were consistent with severe generalized cone system dysfunction but with relative preservation of S-cone sensitivity.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: PDE6C retinopathy is a severe cone dysfunction syndrome often presenting as typical achromatopsia but without foveal hypoplasia. Myopia and slowly progressive maculopathy are common features. There are few (if any) residual foveal cones for intervention in older adults.\n"

      "METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study evaluated 28 patients with pathologic myopia and MHE. The eyes were categorized into IRH and non-IRH sign groups according to IRH sign development. All eyes were evaluated; follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after MHE absorption.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 28 patients (14 eyes each in the IRH and non-IRH groups), nine (32.1%) were men and 19 (67.9%) were women. The average age (mean ± SD) was 46.64 ± 11.92 versus 52.71 ± 12.19 years in the IRH and non-IRH groups. The IRH sign coincided with the MHE invasion site. The sign persisted for the entire follow-up period in all but two eyes, in which it disappeared at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Maximal MHE thickness was significantly greater in the IRH sign group (162.9 ± 67.84 versus 104.2 ± 32.34 μm, p = 0.013). The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity was significantly better in the non-IRH sign group at 12 (p = 0.029) and 24 (p = 0.033) months. The incidence of myopic traction maculopathies (MTM) was significantly higher in the IRH (57.1%) than in the non-IRH sign group (14.3%; p = 0.046).\n",

      " Biallelic variants in EFEMP1 in a man with a pronounced connective tissue phenotype.\n",
      "Connective tissue disorders are a spectrum of diseases that affect the integrity of tissues including skin, vasculature, and joints. They are often caused by variants that disrupt genes encoding components of extracellular matrix (ECM). The fibulin glycoproteins are ECM proteins important for integrity of tissues including dermis, retina, fascia, and vasculature. The fibulin family consists of seven members (fibulins-1 to -7) and is defined by a fibulin-type domain at the C-terminus. The family is associated with human diseases, for instance a variant in FBLN1, encoding fibulin-1, is associated with synpolydactyly, while one in EFEMP1, encoding fibulin-3, causes Doyne honeycomb degeneration of the retina. Loss-of-function of fibulins-4 and -5 causes cutis laxa, while variants in fibulins-5 and -6 are associated with age-related macular degeneration. Of note, EFEMP1 is not currently associated with any connective tissue disorder. Here we show biallelic loss-of-function variants in EFEMP1 in an individual with multiple and recurrent abdominal and thoracic herniae, myopia, hypermobile joints, scoliosis, and thin translucent skin. Fibroblasts from this individual express significantly lower EFEMP1 transcript than age-matched control cells. A skin biopsy, visualised using light microscopy, showed normal structure and abundance of elastic fibres. The phenotype of this individual is remarkably similar to the Efemp1 knockout mouse model that displays multiple herniae with premature aging and scoliosis. We conclude that loss of EFEMP1 function in this individual is the cause of a connective tissue disorder with a novel combination of phenotypic features, and can perhaps explain similar, previously reported cases in the literature.\n"

      " Microarray expression profile and functional analysis of circular RNAs in choroidal neovascularization.\n",
      "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a leading cause of visual loss in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the molecular mechanism for CNV progression is still unclear. This study aimed to identify CNV-related circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of non-coding RNAs with diverse functions. A total of 117 circRNAs were differentially expressed in the murine CNV model by microarrays. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed to identify the functions of selected circRNAs. The host genes of these circRNAs were predicted to be targeted to neurogenesis (ontology: biological process), proteinaceous extracellular matrix (ECM) (ontology: cellular component), and binding (ontology: molecular function). Differentially expressed circRNAs-mediated regulatory networks were enriched in ECM receptor interaction. Most of the dysregulated circRNAs could potentially bind to five different miRNAs by TargetScan and miRanda. Specifically, circ_15752 was identified in this circRNAs pool which may facilitate vascular endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, suggesting a critical role in endothelial angiogenesis. Our work suggests that dysregulated circRNAs may be involved in CNV pathogenesis and serve as potential biomarkers for CNV.\n",

The serum metabolome was profiled by gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) analysis. Multivariate statistical methods as well as data mining were performed for interpretation of macular neovascularization. A total of 446 participants with macular neovascularization and 138 cataract subjects as the control group were enrolled in this study. By employing GC-TOFMS, 131 metabolites were identified and 33 differentiating metabolites were highlighted in patients with macular neovascularization. For differential diagnosis, three panels of specific metabolomics-based biomarkers provided areas under the curve of 0.967, 0.938, and 0.877 in the discovery phase (\n"

      " Three-year outcomes of macular buckling for macular holes and foveoschisis in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To assess the functional and structural outcomes of macular buckling using a silicone sponge-titanium exoplant for the treatment of foveoschisis (FS) and full-thickness macular holes (FTMHs) in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients with high myopia who underwent macular buckling for the treatment of FS and FTMHs were included. The outcomes measured included the anatomical success rate with FS resolution, retinal reattachment, MH closure, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), axial length (AL) and complications of surgery. Moreover, the correlations between the BCVA at year three and series of factors, including age, duration of symptoms, baseline BCVA, AL, surgical type, preoperative macular status and severity of myopic maculopathy, were analysed.\n",
      "RESULTS: This study involved 28 patients (28 eyes) with FS and 21 patients (21 eyes) with FTMHs with macular detachment. Retinal reattachment was achieved in 100% of cases, while MH closure was achieved in 76.19% of cases. The BCVA significantly improved one year after macular buckling in the FS cases and two years after macular buckling in the FTMH cases, and it remained stable throughout the rest of the follow-up period. The mean AL decreased by 2.09 mm postoperatively. No major perioperative complications were observed, although one patient needed to explant the buckling device due to intolerable diplopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Macular buckling with a silicone sponge-titanium exoplant may represent a safe and effective surgical option for the treatment of FS and FTMH in highly myopic eyes. Macular buckling showed a high closure rate and virtually no tendency to recur.\n"

      "DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, parallel, open-label study.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either buckling or vitrectomy group. Macular buckling and intravitreal C3F8 gas injection were performed in the buckling group. Small gauge vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling (ILMP) and C3F8 gas tamponade were performed in the vitrectomy group. The patients were followed for 12 months.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were randomized, 80 eyes were included (41 receiving buckling, 39 received vitrectomy), and 78 patients completed the study. There were less eyes determined as surgical failure and required a second surgery in the buckling group than vitrectomy the group (2.4% versus 18.4%, p = 0.021). After surgery, macular buckling achieved more improvement in BCVA (+21.7 versus +4.5 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, p = 0.002). FTMH development was observed in only 1 (2.4%) eye, after removing of the implant due to recurrent conjunctival erosion, in the buckling group and 10 (26.3%) eyes (seven with-, three without MD) in the vitrectomy group (p < 0.001). More eyes developed cataracts in the vitrectomy group than did in the buckling group (28.9% versus 7.5%, p = 0.014). Macular buckling-associated strabismus (esotropia), binocular diplopia and implant exposure were observed in limited cases.\n",

      "In this cross-sectional study, we investigated whether a foveal curvature affects the development of two major myopic macular complications, myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). In high myopic eyes (axial length ≥ 26.5 mm, refractive error ≤ -6 diopters) with posterior staphyloma, three different parameters of foveal curvature (staphyloma height, coefficient a, and curvature index) calculated based on the retinal pigment epithelium hyperreflective line in spectral domain optical coherence tomography image were compared among the MTM (72 eyes), mCNV (58 eyes), and control (69 eyes) group. The three curvature parameters showed a significant correlation with each other (all P's < 0.001). The axial length, refractive error, and staphyloma types were comparable among the groups, but the means of all three curvature parameters were significantly greater in the MTM group compared to the mCNV and control groups (all P's < 0.001). Furthermore, the curvature parameters had a significant correlation with myopic severity in the MTM group, but not in the other groups. These results suggest that a steeper change of foveal curvature plays a role in the development of MTM but not mCNV in high myopes.\n"

      " How does spending time outdoors protect against myopia? A review.\n",
      "Myopia is an increasingly common condition that is associated with significant costs to individuals and society. Moreover, myopia is associated with increased risk of glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic maculopathy, which in turn can lead to blindness. It is now well established that spending more time outdoors during childhood lowers the risk of developing myopia and may delay progression of myopia. There has been great interest in further exploring this relationship and exploiting it as a public health intervention aimed at preventing myopia in children. However, spending more time outdoors can have detrimental effects, such as increased risk of melanoma, cataract and pterygium. Understanding how spending more time outdoors prevents myopia could advance development of more targeted interventions for myopia. We reviewed the evidence for and against eight facets of spending time outdoors that may protect against myopia: brighter light, reduced peripheral defocus, higher vitamin D levels, differing chromatic spectrum of light, higher physical activity, entrained circadian rhythms, less near work and greater high spatial frequency (SF) energies. There is solid evidence that exposure to brighter light can reduce risk of myopia. Peripheral defocus is able to regulate eye growth but whether spending time outdoors substantially changes peripheral defocus patterns and how this could affect myopia risk is unclear. Spectrum of light, circadian rhythms and SF characteristics are plausible factors, but there is a lack of solid evidence from human studies. Vitamin D, physical activity and near work appear unlikely to mediate the relationship between time spent outdoors and myopia.\n",

      "PURPOSE: The objective of this case series was to describe the clinical and imaging features of focal choroidal elevations (FCE), which are chorioretinal contour changes induced by individual choroidal vessels within an overall thin-appearing choroid.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 787 enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) patient images were initially screened for the presence of FCE. Prospective imaging analysis of 38 patients with FCE was done. Mean central macular choroidal thickness (CMCT), FCE location, FCE vessel lumen diameter, patient demographics, cycloplegic autorefraction, ophthalmoscopic findings, and presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the fellow eye were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: FCE were observed in 25 patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), in 5 patients with high myopia, and in 8 patients with age-related choroidal atrophy (ARCA). Mean patient age was 80 ± 9.4 years. Mean CMCT was 86 ± 40 \n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: FCE are relatively frequently encountered morphologic features of elderly patients with ARMD, high myopia, and ARCA, and have a distinct clinical and imaging morphology which differs from classically described chorioretinal folds. The lesions may commonly be mistaken for pigment epithelial detachments on ophthalmoscopy, may be associated with CNV in fellow eyes, and have a characteristic SD-OCT appearance.\n",

      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we included 22 eyes of 21 consecutive patients who underwent vitrectomy with FSIP or ILMP for MTM and were monitored for at least 6 months. Eleven eyes were treated with FSIP, and 11, with ILMP.\n",
      "RESULTS: With FSIP, the postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) significantly improved from 0.61 (20/82) to 0.34 (20/44; P = .009) logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units. With ILMP, the postoperative BCVA improved from 0.65 (20/89) to 0.52 (20/66) logMAR units, but was not significant (P = .106). The postoperative final central foveal thickness (CFT) reduced significantly after FSIP (from 557.6 to 128.8 µm, P = .003) and ILMP (from 547.3 to 130.3 µm, P = .008). The postoperative incidence of a macular hole was 0% (0/11 eyes) with FSIP and 27.3% (3/11 eyes) with ILMP. All patients with a macular hole had foveal detachment in association with a thin fovea preoperatively. With ILMP, postoperative BCVA with a macular hole worsened by -3.5 letters; in contrast, postoperative BCVA without a macular hole improved by +10.5 letters. With FSIP, postoperative BCVA without a macular hole significantly improved by +13.5 letters (P = .009).\n",

      " Correlation of axial length and myopic macular degeneration to levels of molecular factors in the aqueous.\n",
      "To elucidate the molecular processes associated with the development of myopic macular degeneration (MMD), we measured the intraocular concentrations of molecular factors in emmetropic and myopic eyes. This is a retrospective clinic-based case-control study that included eyes undergoing routine cataract surgery whereby aqueous humour samples were obtained. We measured the concentrations of pigment epithelium derived factor(PEDF), matrix metalloproteinase 2(MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase(TIMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor isoform A(VEGF-A), interleukin 8(IL-8), interleukin 6(IL-6), C-reactive protein(CRP), angiopoietin 2(Ang2), and amphiregulin. 38 eyes (axial length (AL): 22.4-32.4 mm), including 12 highly myopic (HM) eyes (AL ≥ 26.5 mm) without MMD and 12 HM eyes with MMD but without neovascularization were included. Eyes with MMD were found to have significantly lower VEGF-A levels (p = 0.007) and higher MMP-2 levels (p = 0.02) than control eyes after adjusting for age and gender. MMP-2 levels correlated positively (r = 0.58, p = 0.002), while VEGF-A levels correlated negatively with longer axial length (r = -0.75, p < 0.001). Both the concentrations of VEGF-A (P = 0.25) and MMP-2 (P = 0.69) were not significantly associated with MMD after adjusting for AL. These findings suggest that the predominant mechanism underlying the development of non-neovascular MMD may be axial elongation, driven in part by MMP-2 related mechanisms.\n"

The scheduled visual acuity measurements, fundus ophthalmoscopy, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), full-field electrophysiological recordings of scotopic and photopic electroretinograms (ERGs) and colour vision testing could not be carried out in all subjects, because of the mental and physical retardation. The genetic diagnosis was achieved by next-generation sequencing.\n",

Electroretinograms (ERGs) were extinguished in the four patients, whose recording was possible. Genetic testing revealed homozygous or two heterozygous bi-allelic mutations in the VPS13B (COH1) gene in all five patients, with five different allelic variants observed.

      " Cyclodialysis Cleft Associated with Kahook Dual Blade Goniotomy.\n",
      "AIM: The aim of this study is to report cyclodialysis cleft creation during Kahook dual blade (KDB) goniotomy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: No known reports of cyclodialysis clefts have been published to the authors' knowledge after KDB goniotomy.\n",
      "CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old myopic male with primary open angle glaucoma in both eyes (OU) underwent routine cataract extraction and intraocular lens implant with KDB goniotomy in the right eye (OD). Preoperative intraocular pressures (IOP) OD were in the low 20 mm Hg range on timolol and bimatoprost. Postoperative IOP was 4 mm Hg, with a moderate depth anterior chamber. Gonioscopy was slit in all quadrants, with no structures visible, and no improvement on indentation. Mild macular choroidal folds were present OD. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) revealed an area of supraciliary fluid. Anterior chamber reformation with viscoelastic was performed and repeat gonioscopy revealed a cyclodialysis cleft from 2:00 to 3:00. Treatment with multiple sessions of argon laser photocoagulation successfully closed the cleft.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: KDB goniotomy may be complicated by cyclodialysis cleft formation and hypotony maculopathy. Visualization of a cleft on gonioscopy may require anterior chamber reformation.\n",
      "CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: With an increasing use of KDB for goniotomy, previously unreported complications may arise including cyclodialysis cleft and resultant hypotony maculopathy. Because cleft following KDB goniotomy is rare, suspicion may be low and diagnosis could be delayed in the setting of postoperative hypotony with closed angles.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To characterize profile of cytokines in aqueous humour of common macular diseases during intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.\n",
      "METHODS: Aqueous humour from eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), diabetic macular oedema (DME), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) or pathologic myopia associated choroidal neovascularization (pmCNV) was sampled prior to 1st (n = 144) and 2nd (n = 48) intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Cytokines including vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were quantitated and analysed along with retinal thickness data by optical coherence tomography (OCT) across two intravitreal injections and five macular disease types.\n",
      "RESULTS: ICAM-1, IL-6 and VEGF are positively associated in the aqueous humour of naive eyes (r = 0.39-0.77, p = 0.018 to <0.0001). ICAM-1, VEGF and IL-6 were significantly higher in CRVO and DME while lowest in pmCNV (p < 0.0001). Reduction of central retinal thickness (CRT) as a favourable response to anti-VEGF therapy was in the order of CRVO, BRVO, DME and nAMD/pmCNV (p < 0.0001). The strongest predictor for favourable CRT reduction was baseline CRT (p < 0.0001) followed by baseline ICAM-1 (p = 0.04). After the 1st intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, VEGF in aqueous humour lowered significantly but ICAM-1 and IL-6 levels remained unchanged. ICAM-1 was not predictive for CRT reduction following 2nd anti-VEGF therapy.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Rate of cytokine production is disease-dependent and higher in CRVO and DME. Anatomical response to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is disease-specific and best in RVO patients. A combination therapy using both anti-VEGF and anti-inflammatory therapeutics may be superior to single anti-VEGF therapy, at least for RVO and DME.\n",

      "The choroid is involved directly and indirectly in many pathological conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, myopia-related chorioretinal atrophy and central serous chorioretinopathy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has gradually become a fundamental part of modern resources in the hands of ophthalmologists. The enhanced depth imaging technique and swept-source OCT make a great contribution to conventional in vivo choroid assessment. This review focuses on the most common neurological conditions in which choroid assessment by OCT may provide help in early diagnosis and be used as an interdisciplinary follow-up tool.

Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the vessel densities of the SCP and DCP were protective factors for DCA.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The vessel density of the SCP had the highest diagnostic value (sensitivity = 78.0% and specificity = 96.6%). When the SCP vessel density was reduced to ≤49.98%, DCA was indicated. The retinal vessel densities of the SCP and DCP and parameters of the microstructure were reduced significantly in patients with DCA. Vessel density may be a better diagnostic indicator of the development of DCA.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence and causes of blindness and vision impairment (VI) in East Asia in 2015 and to forecast the trend to 2020.\n",
      "METHODS: Through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, we estimated prevalence of blindness (presenting visual acuity <3/60 in the better eye), moderate-to-severe vision impairment (MSVI; 3/60≤presenting visual acuity <6/18), mild vision impairment (mild VI: 6/18≤presenting visual acuity <6/12) and uncorrected presbyopia for 1990, 2010, 2015 and 2020. A total of 44 population-based studies were included.\n",
      "RESULTS: In 2015, age-standardised prevalence of blindness, MSVI, mild VI and uncorrected presbyopia was 0.37% (80% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.12%-0.68%), 3.06% (80% UI 1.35%-5.16%) and 2.65% (80% UI 0.92%-4.91%), 32.91% (80% UI 18.72%-48.47%), respectively, in East Asia. Cataract was the leading cause of blindness (43.6%), followed by uncorrected refractive error (12.9%), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, corneal diseases, trachoma and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The leading cause for MSVI was uncorrected refractive error, followed by cataract, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, corneal disease, trachoma and DR. The burden of VI due to uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, glaucoma and DR has continued to rise over the decades reported.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Addressing the public healthcare barriers for cataract and uncorrected refractive error can help eliminate almost 57% of all blindness cases in this region. Therefore, public healthcare efforts should be focused on effective screening and effective patient education, with access to high-quality healthcare.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To compare treatment results of myopic traction maculopathy according to the international photographic classification for myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-surgeon-based, observational case series of 35 consecutive eyes that underwent vitrectomy for myopic traction maculopathy. Eyes were classified into nonpathologic myopia (PM) (n = 15) and PM (n = 20) groups. Main outcome measures constituted best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and anatomical change.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 32.03 ± 6.85 months. Axial length correlated with myopic maculopathy category (rho = 0.6836, P < 0.001). In the total group, BCVA improved from 20/61 to 20/36 (P = 0.001). In the subgroup, BCVA improved from 20/41 to 20/22 in the non-PM group (P = 0.002), whereas from 20/82 to 20/52 in the PM group (P = 0.048). Postoperative BCVA of the PM group was inferior to that of the non-PM group (P = 0.002) and the PM group was more likely to have postoperative BCVA <20/30 (odds ratio, 17.3; 95% CI, 2.6-325.0; P = 0.012). Two cases of macular hole retinal detachment occurred after surgery in the PM group.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Because there are limited benefits of vitrectomy in myopic traction maculopathy accompanied by PM, careful consideration would be necessary when determining surgery. Optical coherence tomography should not be used alone in determining vitrectomy because myopic traction maculopathy can also have PM defined mainly by fundus photographs.\n",

      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors report patients with Knobloch syndrome who received OCT testing during their care from 2011 to 2016. Diagnosis was based on high myopia, characteristic fundus, and occipital scalp or skull abnormalities with/without featureless irides and/or ectopia lentis. When available, diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of COL18A1 mutations.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the roles of known myopia-associated genetic variants for development of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in individuals with high myopia (HM), using case-control studies from the Consortium of Refractive Error and Myopia (CREAM).\n",
      "METHODS: A candidate gene approach tested 50 myopia-associated loci for association with HM and MMD, using meta-analyses of case-control studies comprising subjects of European and Asian ancestry aged 30 to 80 years from 10 studies. Fifty loci with the strongest associations with myopia were chosen from a previous published GWAS study. Highly myopic (spherical equivalent [SE] ≤ -5.0 diopters [D]) cases with MMD (N = 348), and two sets of controls were enrolled: (1) the first set included 16,275 emmetropes (SE ≤ -0.5 D); and (2) second set included 898 highly myopic subjects (SE ≤ -5.0 D) without MMD. MMD was classified based on the International photographic classification for pathologic myopia (META-PM).\n",
      "RESULTS: In the first analysis, comprising highly myopic cases with MMD (N = 348) versus emmetropic controls without MMD (N = 16,275), two SNPs were significantly associated with high myopia in adults with HM and MMD: (1) rs10824518 (P = 6.20E-07) in KCNMA1, which is highly expressed in human retinal and scleral tissues; and (2) rs524952 (P = 2.32E-16) near GJD2. In the second analysis, comprising highly myopic cases with MMD (N = 348) versus highly myopic controls without MMD (N = 898), none of the SNPs studied reached Bonferroni-corrected significance.\n",

The availability of cross-sectional, high-resolution images is critical for the assessment of several features ranging from early subtle changes to late severe disruption of the anatomy of the retina. The widespread clinical use of OCT enhances the accurate diagnosis of different retinal and choroidal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, vascular occlusions, inflammatory diseases, hereditary diseases.

      "DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 1086 eyes (762 patients) were enrolled. Each participant underwent detailed ocular examinations. Combining the fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images, types of MM were assessed as myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM), myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM), or myopic neovascular maculopathy (MNM) according to the ATN classification system. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) area, tilt ratio, and macular choroidal thickness (mChT) were measured individually.\n",

      "PURPOSE: A posterior staphyloma has been reported to be present in some eyes with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and the purpose of this study was to determine the macular curvature of non-highly myopic RP eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study. The medical charts of the right eyes of 143 patients with RP and 60 controls whose axial length ranged from 21.5 mm to 26.0 mm were reviewed. The mean curvature of Bruch's membrane within 6 mm of the central macula obtained from the horizontal optical coherence tomographic images were evaluated as the mean macular curvature index (MMCI). The relationships between the MMCI and other clinical factors were assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean MMCI of RP patients (-13.73 ± 9.63 × 10-5 μm-1) was significantly lower than that of the controls (-6.63 ± 5.63 × 10-5 μm-1). This indicated a deeper concave shape of the macula in RP eyes (P < 0.001). The MMCI was significantly correlated with the age (r = 0.20; P = 0.016) and the axial length (r = -0.24; P = 0.004). Further analysis suggested a nonlinear effect of the ellipsoid zone width on the macular curvature in the RP eyes.\n",

      "A 48-year-old female presented with complaints of recent onset diminution of vision of the left eye (OS) for the past 2 months. She was highly myopic and was using glasses for the past 30 years. Ocular examination revealed presence of a myopic fundus with high axial lengths in both the eyes. Fundus examination of the OS revealed a myopic tessellated fundus with prominent choroidal vessels and a blunted foveal reflex. There was a small pale whitish lesion just superior to the foveal center. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans (both horizontal and vertical) confirmed presence of dome-shaped maculopathy. There was subretinal fluid in the OS. A vertical OCT scan also revealed a subretinal hyperreflective material, which was confirmed to be due to a small mixed type 1 and type 2 choroidal neovascularization (CNV) on swept-source (SS) OCT angiography in the OS. The patient was given intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 mL) in the OS. At 1-month follow-up, the subretinal fluid completely resolved. The CNV lesion regressed significantly on SS-OCT angiography. The best-corrected visual acuity improved from 20/80 to 20/20 in the OS, which was maintained at 3 months of follow-up.\n",

      " Intrachoroidal cavitation in myopic eyes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine the incidence and characteristics of intrachoroidal cavitation (ICC) in the eyes with high myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective, non-interventional, comparative study, we analysed the case records of 108 eyes with and without pathological myopia (PM). PM was defined as having a refractive error (spherical equivalent) of ≥ - 6.0 D or axial length ≥ 26 mm. The presence of other features like posterior vitreous detachment, myopic traction maculopathy, posterior staphyloma, focal/patchy chorioretinal atrophy (CRA), choroidal neovascularisation and retinoschisis was looked for on OCT. The association of these features with ICC was analysed using statistical tests.\n",
      "RESULTS: In this study, 38 out of 68 eyes with PM and 4 out of 40 eyes with non-PM showed the bowing of the posterior sclera and the presence of ICC. On statistical analysis with Chi-square test and multiple variable linear regression analysis tests, it was identified that the presence of focal/patchy CRA (p = 0.005) and intrascleral vessels (p = 0.018) in and around the cavitation was important features noted in eyes with ICC. The OCT features of macular and peripapillary ICC were similar. The transudation of fluid from the dilated intrascleral vessels in and around the ICC could be one other mechanism responsible for the development of ICC.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: ICC is seen in 55.8% of highly myopic eyes with the presence of focal CRA or myopic conus and/or presence of intrascleral vessels near the cavitation. These findings suggest that patchy atrophy affects the scleral contour within posterior staphyloma beyond the funduscopically identified patchy atrophy by ICC. The presence of intrascleral vessels could also contribute to the ICC development. Eyes with patchy CRA or myopic conus needs to be checked on further follow-up visits for the development of macular or peripapillary ICC.\n"

      "METHODS: High-resolution fluorescein angiography (FFA) and/or indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) images were obtained using a modified Heidelberg retina angiograph (HRA2) device with a reduced scan angle enabling 3° field of view. Colocalized images of the photoreceptor mosaic also were captured in vivo using the same instrument. Visibility of vascular subbranches were compared between high-resolution images and conventional fundus angiography (FA) with a 30° field of view.\n",
      "RESULTS: High-resolution angiographic and infrared images (3° × 3° field of view, a 10-fold magnification) were obtained in 10 participants. These included seven patients with various retinal diseases, including myopic degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, macular telangiectasia, and central serous chorioretinopathy, as well as three healthy controls. Images of the retinal vasculature down to the capillary level were obtained on angiography with the ability to visualize a mean 1.2 levels more subbranches compared to conventional FA. In addition, imaging of the photoreceptor cone mosaic, to a sufficient resolution to calculate cone density, was possible. Movement of blood cells within the vasculature also was discernible on infrared videography.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To investigate structural changes in the retinal outer layers and choroid using adaptive optics (AO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in eyes with myopia, and to correlate the changes with decreased macular light sensitivity (MLS).\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective study included 27 subjects with emmetropia and low myopia (EM/LM), 25 with moderate myopia (MM), and 25 with high myopia (HM). Microperimetry was used to quantify MLS in each subject, while AO and OCT images of fundus were analyzed to quantify cone density and regularity and thickness of outer retinal sublayers and choroid. Differences of MLS, cone distribution, and chorioretinal thicknesses were compared among the three groups, and the associations among photoreceptor morphological alterations, MLS, and other parameters were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: In HM, the MLS, cone density and regularity, and thicknesses of the myoid and ellipsoid zone (MEZ), Henle fiber layer and outer nuclear layer, interdigitation zone and RPE/Bruch complex, and choroid were lower than in EM/LM. Decreased MLS was correlated with lower cone density and regularity, and thinner MEZ and choroid in the inner region, and with lower cone density, thinner MEZ and choroid, and longer axial length in the outer region. Multivariate regression showed that better MLS was correlated with thicker MEZ in the inner region and with higher cone density in the outer region.\n",

Participants with ALs of these values or longer showed a significantly higher OR for myopic maculopathy than those with AL of less than these values (men: OR, 21.23; 95% CI, 8.74-51.57; women: OR, 38.49; 95% CI, 18.03-86.49).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that there was a positive association between AL and the likelihood of myopic maculopathy, and the cutoff levels of AL for identifying myopic maculopathy were 25.9 mm in men and 25.3 mm in women. Our findings suggest that patients with AL close to or longer than these values should undergo intensive treatment and detailed ophthalmic follow-up.\n"

      "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept for patients with choroidal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (cn-AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), macular oedema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO-MO) and myopic choroidal neovascularisation (m-CNV).\n",
      "DESIGN: Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis.\n",
      "METHODS: Multiple databases were searched from inception to 17 August 2017. Eligible head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the (anti-VEGF) drugs in adult patients aged ≥18 years with the retinal conditions of interest. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.\n",
      "RESULTS: 19 RCTs involving 7459 patients with cn-AMD (n=12), DMO (n=3), RVO-MO (n=2) and m-CNV (n=2) were included. Vision gain was not significantly different in patients with cn-AMD, DMO, RVO-MO and m-CNV treated with bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. Similarly, vision gain was not significantly different between cn-AMD patients treated with aflibercept versus ranibizumab. Patients with DMO treated with aflibercept experienced significantly higher vision gain at 12 months than patients receiving ranibizumab or bevacizumab; however, this difference was not significant at 24 months. Rates of systemic serious harms were similar across anti-VEGF agents. Posthoc analyses revealed that an as-needed treatment regimen (6-9 injections per year) was associated with a mortality increase of 1.8% (risk ratio: 2.0 [1.2 to 3.5], 2 RCTs, 1795 patients) compared with monthly treatment in cn-AMD patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab was a reasonable alternative to ranibizumab and aflibercept in patients with cn-AMD, DMO, RVO-MO and m-CNV. The only exception was for patients with DME and low visual acuity (<69 early treatment diabetic retinopathy study [ETDRS] letters), where treatment with aflibercept was associated with significantly higher vision gain (≥15 ETDRS letters) than bevacizumab or ranibizumab at 12 months; but the significant effects were not maintained at 24 months. The choice of anti-VEGF drugs may depend on the specific retinal condition, baseline visual acuity and treatment regimen.\n",

      "Reducing the incidence or prevalence of any disease by 40% is of huge public health significance. Slowing myopia by 1 diopter may do just that for myopic maculopathy-the most common and serious sight-threatening complication of myopia. There is a growing interest in slowing the progression of myopia due to its increasing prevalence around the world, the sight-threatening consequences of higher levels of myopia, and the growing evidence-based literature supporting a variety of therapies for its control. We apply data from five large population-based studies of the prevalence of myopic maculopathy on 21,000 patients. We show that a 1-diopter increase in myopia is associated with a 67% increase in the prevalence of myopic maculopathy. Restated, slowing myopia by 1 diopter should reduce the likelihood of a patient developing myopic maculopathy by 40%. Furthermore, this treatment benefit accrues regardless of the level of myopia. Thus, while the overall risk of myopic maculopathy is higher in a -6-diopter myope than in a -3-diopter myope, slowing their myopic progression by 1 diopter during childhood should lower the risk by 40% in both.\n"

      " Clinical Profile of Low Vision Patients Attending in Low Vision Clinic in a Tertiary Care Hospital.\n",
      "The purpose of the study was to determine the disease profile of patients attending the low vision clinic of a tertiary eye care hospital at National Institute of Ophthalmology & Hospital (NIO&H), Dhaka, Bangladesh July 2016 to June 2017. Low vision and blindness are major causes of morbidity and an economic burden on the individual, family and the country. Low vision service has emerged as a major challenge faced by the developing countries .so prompt diagnosis; early treatment and early use of low vision devices can improve the quality of life. It was a prospective observational study conducted in low vision clinic at a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh for one year. A total 419 patient, aged 6-60 years among them 267(63.7%) were male and 152(36.3%) were female. The leading causes of low vision in patient attending the low vision clinic were Retinitis pigmentosa (31.3%) macular dystrophy/stargards diseases & maculopathy (20.3%) and myopia with macular degeneration (14.8%). The percentage of visual impaired (6/18-6/60) were 38.3%, severely visual impaired (<6/60-3/60) were 24.4% & (<3/60) 37.3%. Almost all the patient was prescribed spectacles and Telescope for distant vision, Hand held magnifier and video magnifier were prescribed for near vision. Vision improved with low vision devices (6/18 or better) in 49.5%, (6/18-6/60) in 47.3%, (<6/60-3/60) in 2.8%, (<3/60) in 0.3% patient. Vision with low vision devices were significantly changes (p=0.001). The present study shows that hereditary ocular anomalies (Retinitis pigmentosa, macular dystrophy, myopic degeneration) and amblyopia were more common causes of low vision in this part of world.\n"

      " Attenuation correction assisted automatic segmentation for assessing choroidal thickness and vasculature with swept-source OCT.\n",
      "Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) is being used more widely in clinical studies to investigate the choroid due to its deeper penetration under the retinal pigment epithelium and improved image quality compared with spectral domain OCT. However, automatic methods to reliably assess choroidal thickness and vasculature are still limited. This paper reports an approach that applies attenuation correction on SS-OCT structural scans to facilitate accurate automatic segmentation of the choroid and provides visualization of the choroidal vasculature without the necessity of OCT angiography. After attenuation correction, enhanced interlayer contrast at the choroidal-scleral interface was observed (from 0.13 ± 0.05 to 0.29 ± 0.10; P < 0.001). An algorithm that segmented the choroid from attenuation compensated B-scans achieved significantly higher accuracy when compared with an automated segmentation performed on regular OCT scans (91.8 ± 3.7% vs.74.5 ± 8.0%; P < 0.01). After attenuation correction, \n",

      "METHODS: Evidence acquisition: We searched Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline by the citation of references and complemented these electronic searches by checking the list of references of included and review articles. Screening, selection, assessment, and extraction was performed in parallel by two authors.\n",
      "RESULTS: Evidence synthesis: Systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis. The ten studies that contributed to the meta-analysis enrolled 440 eyes and allowed constructing ten two-by-two tables. The tables reported on detection of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in eyes suffering from either age-related macular degeneration (4), central serous chorioretinopathy (2), myopia (2), foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy (1), or a mixed cohort suffering from multiple retinal diseases (1).

      "METHODS: Highly myopic patients with cataract and MTM were included. Phacoemulsification surgery was performed on patients who had vision loss below 20/63 and were willing to operation. Exclusion criteria included full thickness macular hole, foveal/retinal detachment, history of vitreoretinal surgery, myopic choroidal neovascularization, macular chorioretinal atrophy, peripheral lattice degeneration, incomplete follow up, or intraoperative complications. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Optical coherence tomography examinations and microperimetry examinations were performed.\n",

Both the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular sensitivity (MS) were significantly improved after cataract surgeries throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.000). No difference was found in the proportion of MTM staging and in the rate of resolving/stable or progressive MTM (p = 0.757) between the operated and the unoperated groups.

      "METHODS: Patients with HM were identified at five retina tertiary referral centers. Inclusion criteria were myopic patients aged 55 years or more with axial lengths equal or greater than 25.5 mm.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 874 eyes from 442 HM subjects older than 55 years were identified and 104 eyes of 54 patients (72 ± 11 years) were included in the study and followed up for 23.5 ± 19.5 months. The estimated AMD frequency in HM subjects over 55 years was 11.9% (95% confidence interval; 9.8%-14.0%). A total of 34 of 104 eyes were diagnosed with drusen, 22 with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), 28 with both drusen and RPD, and 20 with geographic atrophy. Neovascularization was detected in 52 eyes (50%), and type 1 was the most frequent form (39 eyes, 75%). Overall, NV was treated with 4.6 ± 2.6 anti-VEGF injections. Eyes with treatment-naïve NV at baseline (n = 34) required 3.8 ± 1.5 anti-VEGF injections during the first year of treatment. This exceeded the injection number in the purely myopic population (1.8 to 3.6 injections for the first year).\n",

The objective of this study was to describe the imaging characteristics of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) seen on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and to detect biomarkers of the associated functional changes.\n",
      "SUBJECTS/METHODS: We performed OCTA on eyes with MTM and retinoschisis (RS group; n = 27) and highly myopic eyes without MTM (control group; n = 27). The RS group was further divided into a dome-shaped macula (DSM) group and a non-DSM group. The groups were compared for morphologic and perfusion characteristics.\n",
      "RESULTS: The RS and control groups had comparable spherical equivalence (p = 0.65), but the RS group had worse best-corrected visual acuity (p < 0.01), larger retinal volumes (p < 0.01), and greater subfoveal choroid capillary vessel density values (p = 0.04). Compared to the non-DSM group, the DSM group had significantly smaller inner retinal volumes (p = 0.05) and significantly larger choroid capillary vessel density values in both the whole macula (p = 0.005) and the fovea (p = 0.03).\n",

      "Pathologic myopia (PM) is a major cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide and especially in East Asian countries. The complications of PM include myopic maculopathy, myopic macular retinoschisis, dome-shaped macula, and myopic optic neuropathy. Posterior staphyloma is an important component of the diagnosis of PM and one of the hallmarks of PM. The photographic classification and grading system for myopic maculopathy has already been determined. Conventionally optical coherence tomography (OCT) was commonly used in PM and enabled investigators to image deeper tissue such as choroid and sclera. Today, the technological advances in OCT imaging including ultra-widefield OCT and 3-dimensional construction of OCT have given clinicians a novel insight on variable morphology in the PM.\n",

      " We can't afford to turn a blind eye to myopia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopia is becoming increasingly prevalent throughout the world. It is an overlooked but leading cause of blindness, particularly among the working aged population. Myopia is often considered benign because it is easily corrected with glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery. Traditionally myopia has been classified into physiological and pathological subtypes based on the degree of myopia present. Higher levels of myopia are associated with increased risk of pathological complications but it is important to note that there is no safe level of myopia. Even low levels of myopia increase the risk of retinal detachment and other ocular comorbidities which will be discussed in detail later. The most serious complication, myopic maculopathy, is the only leading cause of blindness without an established treatment and therefore leads to inevitable loss of vision in some myopes, even at a young age.\n",
      "AIM: To highlight the current myopia epidemic and the sight threatening complications associated with it.\n",
      "DESIGN: This is a commissioned review article. Data were gathered by performing a literature review, searching the PubMed database for recent articles regarding myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Myopia is a potentially blinding disease. By identifying at risk individuals and intervening before they become myopic, eye care practitioners can prevent or delay spectacle use, reduce the risk of the myriad of myopic complications, thereby improve the patient's quality of life and positively impact its socio-economic effects.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that refractive errors such as myopia and hyperopia cause an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to quantify the degree of risk.\n",
      "DESIGN: Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis of data from a genome-wide association study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: As instrumental variables for refractive error, 126 genome-wide significant genetic variants identified by the Consortium for Refractive Error and Myopia and 23andMe Inc. were chosen. The association with refractive error for the 126 variants was obtained from a published study for a sample of 95,505 European ancestry participants from UK Biobank. Association with AMD for the 126 genetic variants was determined from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) published by the International Age-related Macular Degeneration Genomics consortium of 33,526 (16,144 cases and 17,832 controls) European ancestry participants.\n",
      "METHODS: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to assess the causal role of refractive error on AMD risk, using the 126 genetic variants associated with refractive error as instrumental variables, under the assumption that the relationship between refractive error and AMD risk is linear.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: the risk AMD was caused by a 1-diopter (D) change in refractive error.\n",
      "RESULTS: MR analysis suggested that refractive error had very limited influence on the risk of AMD. Specifically, 1 D more hyperopic refractive error was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.080 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.021-1.142; P = 0.007) increased risk of AMD. MR-Egger, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, weighted median, and Phenoscanner-based sensitivity analyses detected minimal evidence to suggest that this result was biased by horizontal pleiotropy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Under the assumption of a linear relationship between refractive error and the risk of AMD, myopia and hyperopia only minimally influence the causal risk for AMD. Thus, inconsistently reported strong associations between refractive error and AMD are likely to be the result of noncausal factors such as stochastic variation, confounding, or selection bias.\n"

      "CONCLUSIONS: Childhood-onset STGD1 patients were diagnosed with a delay of median 3 years. The presence of accurate competence, equipment, and the possibility for genetic screening is required; therefore, we recommend to refer children with visual complaints without initial fundus abnormalities to a specialized ophthalmologic center. In particular, to diagnose patients at an early stage of disease is of increased importance with the advent of new therapeutic possibilities.\n"

      " Ultra-Widefield Optical Coherence Tomographic Imaging of Posterior Vitreous in Eyes With High Myopia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the morphological changes of posterior vitreous in highly myopic (HM) eyes of patients 50 years of age and older.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.\n",
      "METHODS: Ultra-widefield swept-source OCT (UWF-OCT) examinations were performed on 768 eyes of 448 HM patients (50-89 years of age) and 54 eyes of 52 non-HM subjects with scan widths of 23 mm and depths of 5 mm. HM was defined as an axial length longer than 26.5 mm. The area and morphology of the posterior vitreous detachments (PVDs) and adhesions onto retinal vessels were examined for in 167 HM eyes and in 11 non-HM eyes in which the vitreal images were clear.\n",
      "RESULTS: Paramacular PVD, perifoveal PVD, peripapillary PVD, and complete PVD were found in 9%, 47%, 41%, and 3% of the 167 HM eyes, respectively, and in 37%, 45%, 18%, and 0% of the 11 non-HM eyes, respectively. In eyes with vitreofoveal adhesions, the PVDs were more commonly asymmetrical relative to the fovea in the HM eyes than in the non-HM eyes (94% vs. 44%, respectively; P < .001). The area of the PVD corresponded with the area where the sclera protruded posteriorly. A thickened vitreous was observed to adhere to the retinal vessels at multiple points and was accompanied by paravascular abnormalities including lamellar holes in HM eyes. A total of 54 of the 167 HM eyes had macular retinoschisis, and the eyes commonly had vitreal traction on retinal vessels compared to HM eyes without macular retinoschisis (P = .031).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: PVD progressed asymmetrically and were associated with scleral curvature in HM eyes. Vitreous traction spanning a wide distance may lead to myopic traction maculopathy.\n"

      " Progression of Myopic Maculopathy in Highly Myopic Chinese Eyes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the 2-year changes in myopic maculopathy and its associations in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study involving 657 Chinese participants with bilateral high myopia (≤ -6.00 diopters spherical power), who were followed for 2 years. The worst eye of each participant was considered for the analysis. Myopic maculopathy was graded based on fundus photographs, using the International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean baseline age was 21.6 ± 12.2 years (range, 6.8-69.7 years). Myopic maculopathy progressed in 97 (14.8%) of 657 eyes, of which 24 eyes progressed to a higher category of myopic maculopathy, including from no maculopathy to tessellated fundus in 17 eyes, from tessellated fundus to diffuse atrophy in 6 eyes, and from diffuse to patchy atrophy in 1 eye. Among 122 lesion changes identified, the most common changes were enlargement of diffuse atrophy (n = 50, 41.0%), appearance of lacquer cracks (n = 28, 23.0%), enlargement of patchy atrophy (n = 10, 8.2%) and development of additional lacquer cracks (n = 7, 5.8%). In addition, we identified 1 eye with enlargement of a Fuch's spot, and 1 eye with active choroidal neovascularization. In multiple logistic regression analysis, myopic maculopathy progression was associated with older age, longer axial length, greater change in myopic spherical equivalent and more severe myopic maculopathy at baseline.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Myopic maculopathy progressed in approximately 15% of highly myopic eyes over a 2-year period. Further studies with longer follow up periods are required to confirm identified risk factors for progression.\n"

      " Novel function of VEGF-B as an antioxidant and therapeutic implications.\n",
      "Oxidative stress, due to insufficiency of antioxidants or over-production of oxidants, can lead to severe cell and tissue damage. Oxidative stress occurs constantly and has been shown to be involved in innumerable diseases, such as degenerative, cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic disorders, cancer, and aging, thus highlighting the vital need of antioxidant defense mechanisms. Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) was discovered a long time ago, and is abundantly expressed in most types of cells and tissues. VEGF-B remained functionally mysterious for many years and later on has been shown to be minimally angiogenic. Recently, VEGF-B is reported to be a potent antioxidant by boosting the expression of key antioxidant enzymes. Thus, one major role of VEGF-B lies in safeguarding tissues and cells from oxidative stress-induced damage. VEGF-B may therefore have promising therapeutic utilities in treating oxidative stress-related diseases. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the newly discovered antioxidant function of VEGF-B and the related molecular mechanisms, particularly, in relationship to some oxidative stress-related diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.\n",

      " Ocular dysfunctions and toxicities induced by antiepileptic medications: Types, pathogenic mechanisms, and treatment strategies.\n",
      "Ocular dysfunctions and toxicities induced by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are rarely reviewed and not frequently received attention by treating physicians compared to other adverse effects (e.g. endocrinologic, cognitive and metabolic). However, some are frequent and progressive even in therapeutic concentrations or result in permanent blindness. Although some adverse effects are non-specific, others are related to the specific pharmacodynamics of the drug. Areas covered: This review was written after detailed search in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web, SciELO, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register databases (from 1970 to 2019). It summarized the reported ophthalmologic adverse effects of the currently available AEDs; their risks and possible pathogenic mechanisms. They include ocular motility dysfunctions, retinopathy, maculopathy, glaucoma, myopia, optic neuropathy, and impaired retinal vascular autoregulation. In general, ophthalmo-neuro- or retino-toxic adverse effects of AEDs are classified as type A (dose-dependent), type B (host-dependent or idiosyncratic) or type C which is due to the cumulative effect from long-term use. Expert opinion: Ocular adverse effects of AEDs are rarely reviewed although some are frequent or may result in permanent blindness. Increasing knowledge of their incidence and improving understanding of their risks and pathogenic mechanisms are crucial for monitoring, prevention, and management of patients' at risk.\n"

      " [Epidemiology and anatomy of myopia].\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of myopia has markedly increased, particularly in the young generations in East and Southeast Asia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim is to describe the epidemiology of myopia and the morphological alterations associated with myopia.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of epidemiological, clinical and histological studies are summarized.\n",
      "RESULTS: During the last three decades the prevalence of myopia has markedly increased so that currently 80-90% of 18-years-olds in East Asia are myopic and 10-20% are highly myopic. It is estimated that by 2050 the frequency of myopia worldwide will increase to 50% and high myopia to ca. 10% and high myopia will become the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness due to the association with myopic maculopathy and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Myopia is morphologically characterized by predominantly sagittal and to a lesser extent coronal enlargement of the eyeball. This results in retinal thinning and reduction in the density of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the equatorial region, thinning of the choroid and sclera mostly at the posterior pole, normal retinal thickness and RPE density in the macular region, normal thickness of Bruch's membrane (BM) in any region, elongated disc-fovea distance due to the development of parapapillary gamma and delta zones, enlargement and vertical rotation of the optic disc and elongation and thinning of the lamina cribrosa and peripapillary scleral flange.\n",
      "DISCUSSION: These morphological alterations can possibly be explained by a new formation and elongation of the BM in the equatorial region leading to sagittal elongation of the eyeball.\n"

      "Interpretation of optic disc cupping and neuroretinal rim is challenging in myopic eyes because of large, shallow, and tilted disc, myopic crescent, and macular degeneration. Color and red-free optic disc photographs do not reveal the cup/disc ratio often in myopic eyes. We report characteristics of multicolor optic disc photography in three myopic eyes. All eyes underwent multicolor imaging Spectralis SDOCT system (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany). Owing to use of three laser lights in a confocal design, multicolor optic disc photography was able to delineate the neuroretinal rim and optic cup more clearly than color and red-free optic disc photographs.\n",

      "METHODS: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited using cluster sampling from Yangxi County, Guangdong Province, China from August to November in 2014. Non-cycloplegic autorefraction and fundus photography were performed on all of the participants. Myopic maculopathy was graded based on fundus photographs using the International Classification of Myopic Maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 5825 individuals who participated (90.7% response rate), a total of 4469 participants with gradable fundus photographs for myopic maculopathy and automated refractive data were included in this study. The mean age of these participants was 65.50±9.70 years. The crude prevalence of myopic maculopathy was 1.4% (62/4469; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0% to 1.8 %) and age-standardised prevalence was 1.2% (95% CI 1.1% to 1.2%).

      "PURPOSE: Posterior staphyloma is an ocular complication associated with high myopia and reflects degenerative changes on the sclera. Its morphology is associated with chorioretinal atrophy and myopic maculopathy. The purpose of this study was to validate the efficacy of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in providing a simple estimation of the staphyloma pattern.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational case-series study of high myopic patients with posterior staphylomas. Patients were examined using the star scan pattern OCT in different radial planes. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance tomography was also performed to visualize the anatomical characteristics of the posterior pole. 3D-segmentation and curvature analysis were also performed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eight patients were totally enrolled in this pilot study. Our study pool consisted of 2 wide macular staphylomas, 2 narrow macular staphylomas, and 4 barrel-shaped staphylomas. Our preliminary results revealed that patients displayed mirror-image distortion in the steeper staphyloma axis. In the barrel-shaped subtype, no image distortion was displayed in any plane.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We estimated the axis of the smaller base curvature by noting the distortion pattern in the different radial axis. The recognition of pathologic axial myopia is important since there is a risk of permanent vision loss from vision to threatening sequelae.\n"

      "PURPOSE: Pathologic myopia is a leading cause of visual impairment in East Asia. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential mutations in Chinese pathologic myopic patients and to analyze the correlations between genotype and clinical phenotype.\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred and three patients with pathologic myopia and one hundred and nine unrelated healthy controls were recruited from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center. Detailed clinical data, including ultra-widefield retinal images, measurements of bestcorrected visual acuity, axial length, refractive error and ophthalmic examination results, were obtained. Blood samples were collected for high-throughput DNA targeted sequencing. Based on the screening results, phenotype-genotype correlations were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 196 eyes of 103 patients (36 men and 67 women) with an average age of 52.19 (38.92 - 65.46) years, an average refractive error of -11.80 D (- 16.38 - -7.22) and a mean axial length of 28.26 mm (25.79 - 30.73). The patients were subdivided into three groups: myopic chorioretinal atrophy (190 eyes of 101 patients), myopic choroidal neovascularization (17 eyes of 15 patients), and myopic traction retinopathy (71 eyes of 61 patients). Systematic analysis of variants in the 255 genes revealed six potential pathogenic mutations: PEX7, OCA2, LRP5 (rs545382, c.1647T>C), TSPAN12 (rs41623, c.765G>T), RDH5 (rs3138142, c.423C>T) and TTC21B (rs80225158, c.2385G>C).

      " Pharmacotherapy for Choroidal Neovascularization Due to Uncommon Causes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in adults is most commonly associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and pathologic myopia. Though less common, CNV can also develop from other conditions such as uveitis, central serous chorioretinopathy, angioid streaks, intraocular tumors, hereditary chorioretinal dystrophies, or can be idiopathic in origin. If left untreated, CNV may cause visual loss because of exudation of intraretinal or subretinal fluid, retinal or subretinal hemorrhage, or fibrosis involving the macula. It is well known that one of the main drivers of angiogenesis in CNV development is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and therefore inhibitors of VEGF might be an effective treatment for CNV.\n",
      "METHODS: The goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary in the use of pharmacotherapy especially anti-VEGF therapy, in the treatment of CNV due to uncommon causes.\n",
      "RESULTS: Results from uncontrolled case series and controlled clinical trials have reported good efficacy and safety in using anti-VEGF agents including bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept and ziv-aflibercept in the treatment of CNV due to uncommon causes. Anti-VEGF has also been used in combination with verteporfin PDT and anti-inflammatory agents for treating CNV of various causes.\n",

      " Intravitreal Ranibizumab for the Treatment of Visual Impairment Due to Choroidal Neovascularization Associated with Rare Diseases: Cost-Effectiveness in the UK.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab compared with best supportive care (BSC; considered to be no active treatment) for the treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with causes other than neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and pathologic myopia (PM) in a UK setting.\n",
      "METHODS: An individual patient-level simulation model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of ranibizumab vs. BSC. Regression analyses, performed on patient-level data collected within the pivotal phase III MINERVA trial, modelled visual acuity (VA) progression while patients remained on treatment. Patient utilities were modelled as a function of VA in both eyes and resource use estimates were based on trial data or the literature. Costs were evaluated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and personal social services, with future costs and health outcomes discounted at 3.5% per annum. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted.\n",
      "RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for intravitreal ranibizumab was £1363 per QALY compared to BSC and was associated with an incremental benefit of 1.06 QALYs and an incremental cost of £1444 per patient. Drug and administration costs of intravitreal ranibizumab were offset by the prevention of the development of blindness and its associated costs, while the increase in benefits was driven by a reduction in mortality risk and an improved health-related quality of life attributed to an improvement in VA. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and ranibizumab consistently remained cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000-30,000 per QALY gained for all sensitivity analyses.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Intravitreal ranibizumab is a highly cost-effective intervention for the treatment of CNV due to causes other than nAMD and PM as it delivers substantial QALY gains to patients while making cost savings vs. BSC.\n",

      "METHODS: The population-based Ural Eye and Medical Study included 5,899 (80.5%) individuals out of 7328 eligible individuals aged 40+ years. The participants underwent an ocular and systemic examination. Axial length was measured sonographically (Ultra-compact A/B/P ultrasound system, Quantel Medical, Cournon d'Auvergne, France).\n",
      "RESULTS: Biometric data were available for 5707 (96.7%) individuals with a mean age of 58.8±10.6 years (range:40-94 years; 25%, 50%, 75% quartile: 51.0, 58.0, 66.0 years, respectively). Mean axial length was 23.30±1.10 mm (range: 19.02-32.87mm; 95% confidence interval (CI): 21.36-25.89; 25%, 50%, 75% quartile: 22.65mm, 23.23mm, 23.88mm, resp.). Prevalences of moderate myopia (axial length:24.5-<26.5mm) and high myopia (axial length >26.5mm) were 555/5707 (8.7%;95%CI:9.0,10.5) and 78/5707 (1.4%;95%CI:1.1,1.7), respectively. Longer axial length (mean:23.30±1.10mm) was associated (correlation coefficient r2:0.70) with older age (P<0.001;standardized regression coefficient beta:0.14), taller body height (P<0.001;beta:0.07), higher level of education (P<0.001;beta:0.04), higher intraocular pressure (P<0.001;beta:0.03), more myopic spherical refractive error (P<0.001;beta:-0.55), lower corneal refractive power (P<0.001;beta:-0.44), deeper anterior chamber depth (P<0.001;beta:0.20), wider anterior chamber angle (P<0.001;beta:0.05), thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (P<0.001;beta:-0.04), higher degree of macular fundus tessellation (P<0.001;beta:0.08), lower prevalence of epiretinal membranes (P = 0.01;beta-0.02) and pseudoexfoliation (P = 0.007;beta:-0.02) and higher prevalence of myopic maculopathy (P<0.001;beta:0.08). In that model, prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (any type: P = 0.84; early type: P = 0.46), diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.16), and region of habitation (P = 0.27) were not significantly associated with axial length.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Mean axial length in this typically multi-ethnic Russian study population was comparable with values from populations in Singapore and Beijing. In contrast to previous studies, axial length was not significantly related with the prevalences of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy or region of habitation.\n",

      " OCT-Based Diagnostic Criteria for Different Stages of Myopic Maculopathy.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To analyze the choroidal thickness (CT) of each type of myopic maculopathy, and to establish an OCT-based classification of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, hospital-based, cross-sectional study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Highly myopic (HM) eyes that were examined by swept-source OCT.\n",
      "METHODS: The CT was measured at the subfovea and at 3 mm nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea. Myopic maculopathy was classified as tessellation, diffuse atrophy, patchy atrophy, and macular atrophy (MA) based on the fundus photographs. Diffuse atrophy was subdivided into peripapillary diffuse choroidal atrophy (PDCA) or macular diffuse choroidal atrophy (MDCA).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CT of each type of myopic maculopathy and cut-off value for diagnosis of diffuse atrophy.\n",
      "RESULTS: We studied 1487 eyes of 884 patients (mean age: 58 years; mean axial length [AxL]: 29.9 mm). Subfoveal CT decreased with an increase in the severity of the myopic maculopathy. The mean subfoveal CT in HM eyes with normal fundus was 274.5 μm, with tessellation was 129.1 μm, with PDCA was 84.6 μm, with MDCA was 50.2 μm, with patchy atrophy was 48.6 μm, with choroidal neovascularization-related MA was 27.3 μm, and with patchy atrophy-related MA was 3.5 μm. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal CT to predict the presence of PDCA was 56.5 μm nasally, and the CT to predict the presence of MDCA was 62 μm subfoveally. The subfoveal CT was not significantly different in eyes with MDCA and patchy atrophy. A decrease of the subfoveal CT was associated with an older age (P < 0.001), longer AxL (P < 0.001), presence of myopic maculopathy (P < 0.001), and presence of CNV (P = 0.002). A decrease of best-corrected visual acuity was not significantly associated with the subfoveal CT.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Progressive and continuous choroidal thinning plays a key role in the progression from no maculopathy to tessellation and to diffuse atrophy. The cut-off value of CT can be used for diagnosing PDCA and MDCA. For progression from MDCA to patchy atrophy, factors other than further choroidal thinning such as Bruch membrane defect may be involved. The subfoveal CT was not a predictor of visual acuity in HM eyes without CNV.\n"

      "METHODS: MYRROR was a randomized, double-masked study in patients with myopic CNV treated with IVT-AFL/sham over 48 weeks. At baseline/week 48, images were retrospectively graded for MMD.\n",
      "RESULTS: At baseline, 115 eyes had a valid MMD grading result; at week 48, grading results were available for 99 eyes [IVT-AFL (n = 78)/sham (n = 21)]. Severity of baseline MMD was distributed as follows: category 1: 19/115 (17%); category 2: 67/115 (58%); category 3: 22/115 (19%); category 4: 7/115 (6%). Higher MMD category was associated with older age (nominal p = 0.007) and longer axial length (nominal p = 0.025).

      "PURPOSE: To study the etiology, clinical features, management options, and visual prognosis in various types of atypical macular holes (MHs).\n",
      "METHODS: A review of the literature was performed, which focused on the etiopathogenesis of atypical or secondary MHs, their differentiating clinical features, management strategies, and varied clinical outcomes. Idiopathic or age-related, myopic, and traumatic MHs were excluded.\n",
      "RESULTS: Atypical or secondary MHs arise out of concurrent ocular pathologies (dystrophy, degeneration, or infections) and laser/surgery. The contributing factors may be similar to those responsible for idiopathic or typical MHs, i.e., tangential or anteroposterior vitreofoveal traction or cystoid degeneration. The management is either observation or treatment of the underlying cause. The prognosis depends on the background pathology, duration of disease, and baseline visual acuity governed by the size of MH and morphologic health of underlying RPE and photoreceptors. The closer the morphology of atypical MH is to that of an idiopathic MH, the better the surgical outcome is.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the presence of dome-shaped macula (DSM) is a protective factor for visual acuity after cataract surgery in patients with high myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Included were 891 highly myopic cataract eyes (600 patients) that were examined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) through the central fovea and underwent cataract surgery in our hospital. DSM was defined as an inward bulge >50 µm in horizontal or vertical OCT sections. The incidences of various maculopathies were compared between eyes with and those without DSM. The influences of age, sex, eye laterality, axial length and DSM on postoperative visual acuity were evaluated by multivariate linear regression.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 891 eyes, 123 (13.8%) had DSM. There was a greater association of DSM with extrafoveal retinoschisis (RS) than with other vision-threatening complications such as foveal RS and choroidal neovascularisation. In addition to axial length and age, sex was associated with the presence of DSM (p=0.016). In bilateral high myopia, the incidence of DSM increased with the degree of anisometropia and was more common in the longer eye of patients with anisometropia. Younger age, male sex, shorter axial length and the presence of DSM were associated with better postoperative visual acuity in highly myopic cataract eyes (β=0.124, p=0.002; β=0.142, p<0.001; β=0.275, p<0.001 and β=-0.088, p=0.038, respectively).\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of dome-shaped macula (DSM) in highly myopic eyes among Chinese Han and to detect the correlation with myopic maculopathy and macular complications.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 736 Chinese Han patients (1384 eyes) with high myopia (refractive error≤6.0 diopters or axial length ≥26.5 mm) are reviewed based on information entered into a high-myopia database at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and parafoveal choroidal thickness (PFCT) are measured. The prevalence of DSM in patients with myopic maculopathy is categorised from C0 to C4. Clinical features, including macular complications, SFCT and PFCT, are compared between myopic eyes with and without DSM.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 1384 eyes, 149 (10.77%) show DSM. In highly myopic eyes without macular complications, the best corrected visual acuity is significantly worse in patients with DSM (p=0.002), and the ratio between subfoveal and parafoveal choroidal thickness (S/PCT) is significantly elevated in patients with DSM (p=0.021). The proportion of foveal schisis (17.24% vs 62.86%) is much lower in eyes with DSM compared with those without DSM. However, the proportions of extrafoveal schisis (39.66% vs 5.37%), foveal serous retinal detachment (SRD) (5.17% vs 0) and epiretinal membrane (ERM) (24.14% vs 10.74%) are much higher in eyes with DSM.

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the morphological feature, visual acuity, and prevalence of macular complications in highly myopic eyes with different categories of myopic maculopathy (MM) according to the META-PM classification system.\n",
      "METHODS: The clinical records of 1,132 consecutive patients (1,841 eyes) with high myopia (refractive error ≤ -6D and axial length ≥26.5 mm), who visited the High Myopia Clinic at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 2014 to July 2017, were reviewed. Fundus photograph, optical coherence tomography, axial length, refractive error, and best-corrected visual acuity were measured in each patient. Myopic maculopathy was graded from fundus photographs according to the META-PM classification, including tessellated fundus (C1), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (C2), patchy atrophy (C3), and macular atrophy (C4). Other macular complications, including foveoschisis, extrafoveal schisis, full-thickness macular hole, epiretinal membrane, lacquer cracks, Fuchs spot, choroidal neovascularization, macular hemorrhage, and dome-shaped macula, were also investigated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 1,841 eyes, 58 (3.15%) had no MM (C0), 779 (42.31%) had tessellated fundus only (C1), 524 (28.46%) had diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (C2), 352 (19.12%) had patchy chorioretinal atrophy (C3), and 128 (6.95%) had macular atrophy (C4). Age increased and best-corrected visual acuity became worse with the severity of MM (P < 0.01). Axial length was significantly longer with the severity of MM from C0 to C3 (P < 0.01), and spherical equivalent was greater with the severity of MM from C0 to C3 (P < 0.01) but was not different between C3 and C4 (P > 0.05). Subfoveal and parafoveal choroidal thicknesses were significantly thinner from C0 to C3 (P < 0.01). However, no significant difference was found between C3 and C4 in parafoveal choroidal thickness (P > 0.05). The complications were different among C0 to C4 correlated with MM (P < 0.01).

      "METHODS: Eleven patients with CSNB and 13 healthy subjects were compared. In all subjects, static threshold perimetry was performed using MP1 evaluating the central 6 mm of the retina. This central retinal area was divided into three rings through using the ETDRS grid algorithm with an innermost (1 mm), inner (3 mm) and outer ring (6 mm).

      " Reducing the impact of the impending myopia epidemic in New Zealand.\n",
      "Myopia is an eye condition that is increasing around the world, reaching epidemic levels in many countries. It is associated with a higher risk of other ocular diseases including myopic maculopathy and retinal detachment. Historically in New Zealand myopia has existed at a low level, however the environmental changes that have increased myopia internationally will affect New Zealanders too. Higher levels of myopia will have a profound social, economic and health burden on our country. Fortunately, proven interventions to limit the onset and degree of myopia already exist. To limit the level of myopia in New Zealand we propose the creation of a multidisciplinary myopia action group (NZMAG). The NZMAG will serve to support local research, raise awareness of the condition and its associated pathologies, facilitate access to myopia control treatments, improve identification of at-risk children via screening programs, and serve as the guiding body for myopia-related information. With prompt action now, the myopia epidemic seen in other countries can be reduced in New Zealand.\n"

      " Genome-wide association analyses identify 139 loci associated with macular thickness in the UK Biobank cohort.\n",
      "The macula, located near the center of the retina in the human eye, is responsible for providing critical functions, such as central, sharp vision. Structural changes in the macula are associated with many ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma. Although macular thickness is a highly heritable trait, there are no prior reported genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of it. Here we describe the first GWAS of macular thickness, which was measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography using 68 423 participants from the UK Biobank cohort. We identified 139 genetic loci associated with macular thickness at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8). The most significant loci were LINC00461 (P = 5.1 × 10-120), TSPAN10 (P = 1.2 × 10-118), RDH5 (P = 9.2 × 10-105) and SLC6A20 (P = 1.4 × 10-71). Results from gene expression demonstrated that these genes are highly expressed in the retina. Other hits included many previously reported AMD genes, such as NPLOC4 (P = 1.7 × 10-103), RAD51B (P = 9.1 × 10-14) and SLC16A8 (P = 1.7 × 10-8), further providing functional significance of the identified loci. Through cross-phenotype analysis, these genetic loci also exhibited pleiotropic effects with myopia, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease), cancer (e.g. breast, ovarian and lung cancers) and metabolic traits (e.g. body mass index, waist circumference and type 2 diabetes). Our findings provide the first insight into the genetic architecture of macular thickness and may further elucidate the pathogenesis of related ocular diseases, such as AMD.\n"

      " Current concepts of macular buckle in myopic traction maculopathy.\n",
      "Since its introduction by Charles L. Schepens, macular buckle (MB) surgery has evolved over the past 60 years. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has given a paradigm shift to the understanding of myopic macula, thereby helping in objective evaluation of the various manifestation of traction maculopathy. Staphyloma evaluation by ultrasound, wide-field fundus photography, and MRI scans along with OCT has led to the resurgence of MB surgery in the treatment of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Various surgical techniques with different buckle materials are being performed with encouraging anatomical and functional success rates.

      " Choroidal biomarkers.\n",
      "A structurally and functionally intact choroid tissue is vitally important for the retina function. Although central retinal artery is responsible to supply the inner retina, choroidal vein network is responsible for the remaining one-third of the external part. Abnormal choroidal blood flow leads to photoreceptor dysfunction and photoreceptor death in the retina, and the choroid has vital roles in the pathophysiology of many diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. Biomarkers of choroidal diseases can be identified in various imaging modalities that visualize the choroid. Indocyanine green angiography enables the visualization of choroid veins under the retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal blood flow. New insights into a precise structural and functional analysis of the choroid have been possible, thanks to recent progress in retinal imaging based on enhanced depth imaging (EDI) and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) technologies. Long-wavelength SS-OCT enables the choroid and the choroid-sclera interface to be imaged at greater depth and to quantify choroidal thickness profiles throughout a volume scan, thus exposing the morphology of intermediate and large choroidal vessels. Finally, OCT angiography allows a dye-free evaluation of the blood flow in the choriocapillaris and in the choroid. We hereby review different imaging findings of choroidal diseases that can be used as biomarkers of activity and response to the treatment.\n"

      " Clinical and imaging characteristics of posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa with a specific FLVCR1 mutation.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Posterior column ataxia retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP) with feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1) gene mutation is a rare disorder with significant ophthalmic features.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series study of patients diagnosed with PCARP and genetic testing positive for FLVCR1 mutation between 1 January 2015 and 1 October 2017 at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Clinical charts, visual fields, fundus autofluorescence, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were reviewed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Seven patients from three families were identified to have PCARP and FLVCR1 mutation. The median age at presentation was 13 years (range, 7-28 years). Common clinical exam findings were astigmatism, cataracts, and vitreous syneresis. Funduscopy on all patients revealed bull's eye maculopathy, retinal vessels attenuation, and bone spicule changes in the peripheral retina. Fundus autofluorescence showed bilateral hyperautofluorescent rings. SD-OCT demonstrated morphological changes, which differed based on age. The youngest sibling family exhibited peripheral loss, but subfoveal preservation of the outer retinal layers. These layers were lost in the oldest sibling family. Visual fields loss paralleled SD-OCT findings.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: There is limited published ophthalmic data on FLVCR1-related PCARP. We describe clinical and retinal imaging features in the one of the largest cohorts of affected patients in the literature. Given the availability of genetic testing for this phenotype, testing for FLVCR1 mutations should be considered in pediatric and adult patients with sensory ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: To assess prevalence and causes of vision loss in Central and South Asia.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic review of medical literature assessed the prevalence of blindness (presenting visual acuity<3/60 in the better eye), moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI; presenting visual acuity <6/18 but ≥3/60) and mild vision impairment (MVI; presenting visual acuity <6/12 and ≥6/18) in Central and South Asia for 1990, 2010, 2015 and 2020.\n",
      "RESULTS: In Central and South Asia combined, age-standardised prevalences of blindness, MSVI and MVI in 2015 were for men and women aged 50+years, 3.72% (80% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.39-6.75) and 4.00% (80% UI: 1.41-7.39), 16.33% (80% UI: 8.55-25.47) and 17.65% (80% UI: 9.00-27.62), 11.70% (80% UI: 4.70-20.32) and 12.25% (80% UI:4.86-21.30), respectively, with a significant decrease in the study period for both gender. In South Asia in 2015, 11.76 million individuals (32.65% of the global blindness figure) were blind and 61.19 million individuals (28.3% of the global total) had MSVI. From 1990 to 2015, cataract (accounting for 36.58% of all cases with blindness in 2015) was the most common cause of blindness, followed by undercorrected refractive error (36.43%), glaucoma (5.81%), age-related macular degeneration (2.44%), corneal diseases (2.43%), diabetic retinopathy (0.16%) and trachoma (0.04%). For MSVI in South Asia 2015, most common causes were undercorrected refractive error (accounting for 66.39% of all cases with MSVI), followed by cataract (23.62%), age-related macular degeneration (1.31%) and glaucoma (1.09%).\n",

      " Evaluation of the Relationship Between Age-related Macular Degeneration and Refractive Error, Socio-demographic Features, and Biochemical Variables in a Turkish Population.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and refractive error and axial length, as well as the socio-demographic characteristics and biochemical variables that may affect this relationship.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 196 eyes of 98 patients over 50 years of age who were diagnosed with AMD at our clinic were included in this cross-sectional study. Early and late AMD findings were categorized according to the age-related eye disease study grading scale. Objective refractive error was measured by autorefractometer, confirmed by subjective examination, and spherical equivalent was calculated. Refractive errors of -0.50 D to 0.50 D were classified as emmetropia, <-0.50 D as myopia, and >0.50 D as hyperopia. Axial length was measured by ultrasonic biometry and values ≤23.00 mm were classified as short, >23.00 and <24.00 mm as normal, and ≥24.00 mm as long axial length. Demographic, systemic, and biochemical parameters of all patients were also investigated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Hypermetropic refractive error and shorter axial length were significantly more common than the other groups (p<0.01). No differences were observed between early and late stage groups in terms of refractive error and axial length. Patients with myopia had significantly lower values for total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, and proportion of smokers. Rates of oral nutritional supplement use and fish consumption were significantly higher in the early AMD group. The most common comorbidity among the AMD patients in our study was essential hypertension.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Hyperopic refractive error and shorter axial length were found to be associated with AMD. Longitudinal studies including larger patient numbers are needed to elucidate the causal and temporal relationship between hyperopic refractive error and AMD.\n"

      " Myopic maculopathy: Current status and proposal for a new classification and grading system (ATN).\n",
      "Myopia is a highly frequent ocular disorder worldwide and pathologic myopia is the 4th most common cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries. Pathologic myopia is especially common in East Asian countries. Ocular alterations associated with pathologic myopia, especially those involving the macular area-defined as myopic maculopathy-are the leading causes of vision loss in patients with pathologic myopia. High myopia is defined as the presence of a highly negative refractive error (>-6 to -8 diopters) in the context of eye elongation (26-26.5 mm). Although the terms high myopia and pathologic myopia are often used interchangeably, they do not refer to the same eye disease. The two key factors driving the development of pathologic myopia are: 1) elongation of the axial length and 2) posterior staphyloma. The presence of posterior staphyloma, which is the most common finding in patients with pathologic myopia, is the key differentiating factor between high and pathologic myopia. The occurrence of staphyloma will, in most cases, eventually lead to other conditions such as atrophic, traction, or neovascular maculopathy. Posterior staphyloma is for instance, responsible for the differences between a myopic macular hole (MH)-with and without retinal detachment-and idiopathic MH. Posterior staphyloma typically induces retinal layer splitting, leading to foveoschisis in myopic MH, an important differentiating factor between myopic and emmetropic MH. Myopic maculopathy is a highly complex disease and current classification systems do not fully account for the numerous changes that occur in the macula of these patients. Therefore, a more comprehensive classification system is needed, for several important reasons. First, to more precisely define the disease stage to improve follow-up by enabling clinicians to more accurately monitor changes over time, which is essential given the progressive nature of this condition. Second, unification of the currently-available classification systems would establish standardized classification criteria that could be used to compare the findings from international multicentric studies. Finally, a more comprehensive classification system could help to improve our understanding of the genetic origins of this disease, which is clearly relevant given the interchangeable-but erroneous-use of the terms high and pathologic myopia in genetic research.\n"

      " Distribution and Severity of Myopic Maculopathy Among Highly Myopic Eyes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to document the distribution of the severity of myopic maculopathy in a cohort of highly myopic patients and to explore the associated risk factors.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 890 Chinese highly myopes aged between 7 and 70 years (median age 19 years) and with spherical refraction -6.00 diopter (D) or worse in both eyes were investigated. All participants underwent detailed ophthalmic examination. Myopic maculopathy was graded into 5 categories according to the International Photographic Classification and Grading System using color fundus photographs: category 0, no myopic retinal lesions, category 1, tessellated fundus only; category 2, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy; category 3, patchy chorioretinal atrophy; category 4, macular atrophy. Category 2 or greater were further classified as clinically significant myopic maculopathy (CSMM).\n",
      "RESULTS: Data from 884 of 890 right eyes were available for analysis. The proportions of category 1, category 2, category 3, and category 4 were 20.0% (177 eyes), 20.2% (178 eyes), 2.6% (23 eyes), and 0.2% (2 eyes), respectively. The proportion of CSMM increased with more myopic refraction (odds ratio 1.57; 95% confidence interval: 1.46-1.68), longer axial length (odds ratio 2.97; 95% confidence interval: 2.50-3.53), and older age (40-70 years compared to 12-18 years, odds ratio 6.77; 95% confidence interval: 3.61-12.70). However, there was a higher proportion of CSMM in children aged 7 to 11 years than those aged 12 to 18 years (20.9% vs. 11.0%, P = 0.008).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Older age, more myopic refraction, and longer axial length were associated with more severe myopic maculopathy. Although CSMM was uncommon among younger participants, children with early-onset high myopia have a disproportionately increased risk.\n"

      " Potential Lost Productivity Resulting from the Global Burden of Myopia: Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Modeling.\n",
      "PURPOSE: We estimated the potential global economic productivity loss resulting from vision impairment (VI) and blindness as a result of uncorrected myopia and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in 2015.\n",
      "CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the economic burden of VI associated with myopia is critical to addressing myopia as an increasingly prevalent public health problem.\n",
      "METHODS: We estimated the number of people with myopia and MMD corresponding to critical visual acuity thresholds. Spectacle correction coverage was analyzed against country-level variables from the year of data collection; variation in spectacle correction was described best by a model based on a human development index, with adjustments for urbanization and age. Spectacle correction and myopia data were combined to estimate the number of people with each level of VI resulting from uncorrected myopia. We then applied disability weights, labor force participation rates, employment rates, and gross domestic product per capita to estimate the potential productivity lost among individuals with each level and type of VI resulting from myopia in 2015 in United States dollars (US$). An estimate of care-associated productivity loss also was included.\n",
      "RESULTS: People with myopia are less likely to have adequate optical correction if they are older and live in a rural area of a less developed country. The global potential productivity loss associated with the burden of VI in 2015 was estimated at US$244 billion (95% confidence interval [CI], US$49 billion-US$697 billion) from uncorrected myopia and US$6 billion (95% CI, US$2 billion-US$17 billion) from MMD. Our estimates suggest that the Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Asia Global Burden of Disease regions bear the greatest potential burden as a proportion of their economic activity, whereas East Asia bears the greatest potential burden in absolute terms.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Even under conservative assumptions, the potential productivity loss associated with VI and blindness resulting from uncorrected myopia is substantially greater than the cost of correcting myopia.\n"

      " Diagnosis and Treatment of Myopic Maculopathy.\n",
      "Visual impairment resulting from pathologic myopia is a serious issue worldwide. This is mainly due to the development of different types of myopic maculopathy. Despite being a major cause of visual impairment worldwide, myopic maculopathy was not consistently defined. To overcome this problem, in 2015 the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia Study Group proposed a simplified, uniform classification system for myopic maculopathy. Among several lesions of myopic maculopathy, myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most common and severe vision-threatening complications. Recent large clinical trials have reported a good initial efficacy for visual acuity improvement by application of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for myopic CNVs. However, long-term clinical studies demonstrate a gradual decrease in the visual acuity gain and return to the baseline level due to the development of myopic CNV-related macular atrophy. Regarding visual impairment caused by advanced myopic chorioretinal atrophy, the only way to prevent blindness is to prevent myopia from developing or progressing at a young age before the axial length elongates extremely. As peripapillary diffuse atrophy in childhood may be an indicator of more advanced myopic chorioretinal atrophy in later life, some preventive measures should be considered in such children.\n",

      " Visual rehabilitation using microperimetric acoustic biofeedback training in individuals with central scotoma.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Patients with central scotoma have poor fixation stability and poor visual acuity. Acoustic biofeedback training can be an effective way to train such patients to eccentrically fixate. This study analyses the mean retinal sensitivity, saccadic velocity, and fixation stability after acoustic biofeedback training and shows correlation with age and scotoma size.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients with irreversible central scotoma in both the eyes secondary to macular diseases were selected. After undergoing comprehensive low vision assessment, 19 patients who were willing were recruited for the acoustic biofeedback training to the better eye in 10 sessions, using the MP-1 Microperimeter. Mean retinal sensitivity, saccadic velocity, fixation stability before and after the acoustic biofeedback were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: There were 17 men and two women. Ages ranged from 19-94 years (mean 54.63 ± 24.66). The scotoma size ranged from four to 20 degrees. Ten patients had age-related macular degeneration, four had Stargardt disease, three had traumatic macular scar, two had scarred myopic choroidal neovascular membrane, and one had myopic macular degeneration. The vision improved from 1.06 ± 0.36 to 0.86 ± 0.33 logMAR (p < 0.0001). The mean retinal sensitivity improved from 2.1 ± 2.9 dB to 2.7 ± 3.1 dB (p = 0.01), with negative correlation with age (p = 0.01) and scotoma size (p = 0.02). Fixation stability improved with reduction in the bivariate contour ellipse area (p = 0.01). It showed negative correlation with age (p = 0.02) and scotoma size (p = 0.10). The saccadic velocity reduced from 0.34°/second to 0.26°/second but was not significant (p > 0.99). The majority (58 per cent) had their preferred retinal locus superior to the fovea. There was good agreement between bivariate contour ellipse area and MP-1 Microperimeter inbuilt fixation parameters. The effect was maintained at six months with slight reduction in fixation stability.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Acoustic biofeedback can improve fixation behaviour, visual acuity and retinal sensitivity in patients with central scotoma. The results are better with younger age and smaller scotoma size.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) on visual impairment and functioning among adults in Singapore.\n",
      "METHODS: A comprehensive eye examination, including subjective refraction, axial length, and visual acuity (VA) measurements, was performed in adults aged ≥40 years in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study. From fundus photographs, MMD was graded using the International META-PM classification. Vision-specific functioning (VSF) was assessed with a validated visual-functioning questionnaire (VF-11) using Rasch analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 8716 phakic subjects were included in this analysis. The mean age (± SD) was 57.2 ± 9.5 years (33.5% Malays, 33.2% Indians, and 33.3% Chinese). The prevalence of myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] ≤ -0.5 diopters [D]) and high myopia (SE ≤ -5.0 D) was 35.7% and 6.0%, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence of MMD was 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4-4.3%). The prevalence of MMD was 7.7% among low to moderate myopes, and 28.7% among high myopes. The prevalence of MMD increased nonlinearly with SE and age. MMD was associated with older age, more myopic SE, and lower education. Subjects with Meta-PM categories 3 or 4 in the better-seeing eye had worse best-corrected VA (β, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.16-0.23) and poorer VSF (β, -9.7; 95%CI, -17.6 to -1.8) than those without MMD after multivariate adjustments.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in 26 phakic adults in Singapore has MMD. Older age and myopic SE are major risk factors of MMD. Severe MMD has a substantial impact on visual impairment and functioning.\n"

      "Macular hole associated with high myopia (MH-HM) and macular hole-associated retinal detachment (MH-RD) are two conditions found in eyes with pathologic myopia that often have poor postoperative outcomes. A discrepancy in size between the stretched retina and the posteriorly expanded sclera is a major factor in the pathogenesis. The authors report a case comprising both types of maculopathy, one in each eye. The eye with the MH-HM (right eye) represents the longest axial length ever reported to have successful macular hole closure by any technique.

      "RESULTS: The age-standardised prevalence of blindness for all ages and both genders was higher in the Oceania region but lower for MSVI when comparing the subregions. The prevalence of near vision impairment in people≥50 years was 41% (uncertainty interval (UI) 18.8 to 65.9). Comparison of the data for 2015 with 2020 predicts a small increase in the numbers of people affected by blindness, MSVI and mild VI in both subregions. The numbers predicted for near VI in South-east Asia are from 90.68 million in 2015 to 102.88 million in 2020. The main causes of blindness and MSVI in both subregions in 2015 were cataract, uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, corneal disease and age-related macular degeneration. There was no trachoma in Oceania from 1990 and decreasing prevalence in South-east Asia with elimination predicted by 2020.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In both regions, the main challenges for eye care come from cataract which remains the main cause of blindness with uncorrected refractive error the main cause of MSVI. The trend between 1990 and 2015 is for a lower prevalence of blindness and MSVI in both regions.\n"

      "RESULTS: The age-standardised prevalence of blindness and MSVI for all ages and genders decreased from 1990 to 2015, from 1.72 (0.53-3.13) to 0.95% (0.32%-1.71%), and from 6.66 (3.09-10.69) to 4.62% (2.21%-7.33%), respectively, with slightly higher figures for women than men. Cataract was the most common cause of blindness in 1990 and 2015, followed by uncorrected refractive error. Uncorrected refractive error was the leading cause of MSVI in the NAME region in 1990 and 2015, followed by cataract. A reduction in the proportions of blindness and MSVI due to cataract, corneal opacity and trachoma is predicted by 2020. Conversely, an increase in the proportion of blindness attributable to uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy is expected.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In 2015 cataract and uncorrected refractive error were the major causes of vision loss in the NAME region. Proportions of vision impairment from cataract, corneal opacity and trachoma are expected to decrease by 2020, and those from uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration are predicted to increase by 2020.\n"

      " The uncommon occurrence of two common inherited disorders in a single patient: a mini case series.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Inherited eye disorders are genetically determined conditions that are present from birth and usually manifest early, although some may develop later in life. Despite their low incidence, they are a common etiology of pediatric blindness. The occurrence of more than one such disease in a patient is very rare.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: Case series of two unrelated patients with simultaneous Stargardt disease (STGD1) as well as Stickler's Syndrome (SS), both genetically confirmed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patient 1: 13-year-old girl was referred for unexplained bilateral decreased vision for 6 months. She had a clinical diagnosis of SS, same as her mother. Her visual acuity was 20/200 with high myopia in both eyes. Her fundus showed foveal/perifoveal atrophy, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes and beaded vitreous. Goldman visual fields (GVF) revealed enlarged blind spots with central depression. A macular dystrophy was suspected. Genetic testing revealed SS, COL11A1 gene mutation; and STGD1, ABCA4 gene mutation. Patient 2: 67-year-old female with a history of hearing loss, cleft palate, strabismus and myopia, same as her daughter and granddaughters. Her visual acuity was 20/400 and 20/250 with high myopia in both eyes. Her fundus showed macular pigment clumping and RPE atrophy with no vitreous abnormality. GVF revealed a relative central scotoma with generalized constriction. Genetic testing revealed SS, COL11A2 gene mutation; and STGD1, ABCA4 gene mutation.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: If a patient's signs/symptoms cannot be explained by the working/known diagnosis, additional work up should be pursued for concomitant diseases. SS and STGD1 are commonly diagnosed inherited eye disorders and can coexist in one patient on rare occasions.\n"

      "METHODS: Interventional case report.\n",
      "RESULTS: A 59-year-old white man with high myopia presented with blurriness in the left eye. Vision was 20/20 bilaterally. Optical coherence tomography showed subretinal thickening and fluid without definitive leakage on fluorescein angiography after which anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy was initiated. The patient was diagnosed with persistent placoid maculopathy based on multimodal imaging and clinical response. His disease course was characterized by multiple bilateral recurrences despite active treatment.

      " Tessellated fundus appearance and its association with myopic refractive error.\n",
      "The appearance of tessellated fundus in an eye may act as a marker in identifying visual performance, degree of myopia or risk of progression of myopia in a given eye. A systematic literature search using key words was performed using PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar and of the 832 studies identified, 10 full-length articles, which met the inclusion criteria, were considered for review. The primary outcome measures were association of tessellated fundus with: (i) visual acuity, (ii) refractive error, (iii) axial length, (iv) choroidal thickness and (v) future progression of myopia when compared to either no myopic maculopathy, or more severe myopic maculopathy. There was no significant difference in the visual acuity noted between eyes with normal fundus and tessellated fundus appearance. Compared to eyes with tessellated fundus, eyes with more severe myopic maculopathy had a four-line decrease in best-corrected visual acuity, more myopia (mean difference 2.75 D, range 0.28-5.78 D) and a longer axial length (mean difference 2 mm, range 2.29 to 1.71 mm). Eyes with tessellated fundus generally exhibited a significant decrease in choroidal thickness compared to eyes with no maculopathy. In mostly older individuals, eyes with tessellated fundus had a better outcome with respect to visual acuity, degree of myopia and axial length compared to other severe myopic maculopathies, but had a worse outcome for choroidal thickness and degree of myopia, compared to eyes with no myopic maculopathy. The features such as reduced choroidal thickness combined with a predilection to infra-temporal and parapapillary regions may indicate regions of stress that are prone to more stretching/atrophic changes. This systematic review demonstrated an association of tessellated fundus with visual acuity, refractive error, axial length and choroidal thickness and hence emphasises the documentation of the presence and location of tessellated fundus appearance that may help in predicting the progression of myopia.\n"

      " Spectrum of Darkness, Agent of Light: Myopia, Keratoconus, Ocular Surface Disease, and Evidence for a Profoundly Vitamin D-dependent Eye.\n",
      "Serial observations obtained over more than eight years and 10,000 patient encounters in a general ophthalmology practice serving a population highly prone to chronic vitamin D (D3) deficiency, facilitated by the Oculus Pentacam Scheimpflug imaging system (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), resulted in the recognition of consistent, predictable, and highly reproducible patterns of mechanical, optical, and physiologic change in the cornea and other ocular structures correlated to adequate vs. inadequate vitamin D availability. These patterns were identified from an analysis of more than 20,000 topographical and digital imaging studies, manifest refraction results, and other clinical ophthalmic exam findings recorded during patient visits. The main outcome measures included improved corneal and global optical quality and function, decreased ametropia, improved stability, and decreased subjective symptoms of compromised acuity and comfort. Adequate D3 replacement consistently yielded some degree of objective structural improvement in all subjects observed. The rate of improvement varied and synergistic interaction with cofactors was also suggested in particular topical steroids. A plausible explanation for the cause and mechanism of most myopia emerged and keratoconus, in particular, appears to be the extreme presentation of otherwise common corneal disturbances associated with inadequate vitamin D availability. Emmetropization mechanisms appear to awaken and reactivate with adequate D3. Intraocular pressure control likewise shows evidence of being vitamin D regulated and may play a significant interactive role in emmetropization and relief from ametropia. Ocular surface disease and inflammatory activity can be markedly alleviated in addition. As the findings are most readily appreciated via topographical map changes, a series of case reports are presented, selected from the mass of similar data, to illustrate specific aspects of these findings in the hope of inspiring controlled trials to better delineate their significance. Taken as a whole, these observations suggest the human eye may be profoundly dependent upon adequate vitamin D availability for many critical optical, structural, and physiologic properties. Myopia may represent the end result of adverse emmetropization feedback generated by low vitamin D-related irregular corneal astigmatism.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To report a case of macular vortex vein imaged with indocyanine green angiography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography.\n",
      "METHODS: Observational case report.\n",
      "RESULTS: A 51-year-old myopic man presented with the complaint of a floater in his left eye for the previous 2 weeks. His visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Biomicroscopy was normal. Retinoscopy revealed lattice degeneration and posterior vitreous detachment of both eyes with dilated submacular vasculature in the right eye and submacular hemorrhage in the left eye. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography demonstrated dilated vessels in the choroid of the right eye and a choroidal neovascular membrane in the left eye. Fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography showed a macular vortex vein in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography angiography demonstrated normal vessel densities in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses. No abnormalities were detected in the outer retina or choriocapillaris. Optical coherence tomography angiography delineated the macular vortex vein with a relative flow void in the right eye. His vision remained stable in the right eye.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Macular vortex veins may be a prominent, albeit rare, incidental finding in highly myopic eyes. Further studies with application of newer optical coherence tomography angiography modalities, such as swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography, are recommended to improve our understanding and monitoring of these structures.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To present a case of unilateral stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis in a patient with macular telangiectasia (MacTel) Type 2.\n",
      "METHODS: Single-patient case report.\n",
      "RESULTS: A 61-year-old female white patient was referred to our clinic with metamorphopsia and reduction of visual acuity over a period of 2 months on her right eye. Ocular findings in her right eye included reduced best-corrected visual acuity of 20/63 Snellen, foveomacular retinoschisis with extension to the lower middle periphery, central elevation of the neurosensory retina, and macular telangiectasia (MacTel) Type 2. Other causes of foveomacular retinoschisis, such as glaucoma, myopic degeneration, optic or scleral pit, X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, degenerative retinoschisis, and vitreomacular traction, were ruled out. The patient had no history of niacin or taxane medication, which may cause rather similar appearing cases of cystoid macular edema without leakage in fluorescein angiography. Because of the unilateral presentation, uneventful medical history, female sex, and the absence of known hereditary diseases or retinal pathologies in the patient's family history, hereditary predisposition appears to be highly unlikely.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis in combination with MacTel Type 2. Whether or not MacTel Type 2 plays a role in the development of stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis or has an impact on its clinical course requires further investigation. Furthermore, we suggest a significant involvement of Henle fiber layer in the process of intraretinal expansion in optical coherence tomography, in accordance with the most recent published nomenclature.\n"

A newly approved anti-VEGF drug Conbercept has shown good efficacy and safety in rigorous random controlled trials (RCT), however, it cannot fully reflect the clinical application of Conbercept in real world clinical practice. Moreover, anti-VEGF drugs are expensive and often require multiple treatments, and some patients have poor or even no response to the drugs,this resulted enormous waste of medical resources. Therefore, how to find out those patients who have good response, and how to develop individualized therapeutic regimen in real world need to be urgently investigated in the aspect of pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics.\n",
      "METHODS: This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational study of Conbecept treating macular neovascular diseases in China. Patients suffered from age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, and pathological myopia who already planned to receive Conbercept treatment will be recruited. We aimed to enroll more than 5000 patients from 43 ophthalmic centers in China. Patients' clinical data and blood samples will be collected during the one-year follow-up period. Finally, the safety and efficacy of Conbercept, and the potential predictors of patients' response to Conbercept will be investigated by pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics analysis.\n",

      " Long-term Progression and Risk Factors of Fundus Tessellation in the Beijing Eye Study.\n",
      "To assess the progression of fundus tessellation, color fundus photographs of the participants of the longitudinal population-based Beijing Eye Study were examined. The study included 4439 subjects in 2001 and 2695 (66.4% of the surviving) individuals in 2011. Larger progression in macular fundus tessellation (mean: 0.24 ± 0.48 grades) was associated (multivariate analysis; correlation coefficient r: 0.53) with thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness in 2011 (P < 0.001; standardized regression coefficient beta: -0.37), older age (P < 0.001; beta: 0.22), higher level of education (P < 0.001; beta: 0.09), more myopic change in refractive error (P < 0.001; beta: -0.09) and lower cognitive function score (P = 0.02; beta: -0.05). Larger increase in peripapillary fundus tessellation (mean: 0.19 ± 0.26 grades) correlated with thinner peripapillary choroidal thickness in 2011 (P < 0.001; beta: -0.35), older age (P < 0.001; beta: 0.20), worse best corrected visual acuity (P = 0.001; beta: 0.07), more myopic change in refractive error (P < 0.001; beta: -0.07) and higher prevalence of ever smoking (P = 0.004; beta: 0.05). The increase in macular fundus tessellation, as a surrogate for thinning of the posterior choroid, was associated with lower cognitive function, after adjusting for choroidal thickness, age, educational level and change in refractive error. The findings point to the clinical value of the assessment of fundus tessellation and suggest potential associations between cognitive function and fundus tessellation/choroidal thickness.\n"

      " Structure-Preserving Guided Retinal Image Filtering and Its Application for Optic Disk Analysis.\n",
      "Retinal fundus photographs have been used in the diagnosis of many ocular diseases such as glaucoma, pathological myopia, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. With the development of computer science, computer aided diagnosis has been developed to process and analyze the retinal images automatically. One of the challenges in the analysis is that the quality of the retinal image is often degraded. For example, a cataract in human lens will attenuate the retinal image, just as a cloudy camera lens which reduces the quality of a photograph. It often obscures the details in the retinal images and posts challenges in retinal image processing and analyzing tasks. In this paper, we approximate the degradation of the retinal images as a combination of human-lens attenuation and scattering. A novel structure-preserving guided retinal image filtering (SGRIF) is then proposed to restore images based on the attenuation and scattering model. The proposed SGRIF consists of a step of global structure transferring and a step of global edge-preserving smoothing. Our results show that the proposed SGRIF method is able to improve the contrast of retinal images, measured by histogram flatness measure, histogram spread, and variability of local luminosity. In addition, we further explored the benefits of SGRIF for subsequent retinal image processing and analyzing tasks. In the two applications of deep learning-based optic cup segmentation and sparse learning-based cup-to-disk ratio (CDR) computation, our results show that we are able to achieve more accurate optic cup segmentation and CDR measurements from images processed by SGRIF.\n"

      " Incidence of and Factors Associated With Myopia and High Myopia in Chinese Children, Based on Refraction Without Cycloplegia.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Myopia has reached epidemic levels among children in regions of East and Southeast Asia. High myopia is associated with myopic macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinal detachment.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of myopia and high myopia based on refraction without cycloplegia among children in primary and junior high schools in China.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study was completed in Guangzhou, China. It consisted of a cohort from 19 primary schools, who were followed up from 2010 to 2015, and a cohort from 22 junior high schools, who were followed up from 2010 to 2012. All schools were randomly chosen at rates proportional to the number of schools in each of the city's 11 districts. Students with or without myopia in grade 1 (primary school) or grade 7 (junior high school) were eligible for inclusion. Data analysis occurred from February 2017 to October 2017.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of -0.50 diopters (D) or less, as measured by subjective refraction without cycloplegia; high myopia was defined as a SER of -6.0 D or less. Annual incidences were defined as the proportion of participants each year found to have myopia or high myopia who did not previously have the condition. Height, weight, axial length (AL), corneal radius of curvature (CRC), and AL/CRC ratio were examined to assess if these measures were associated with future myopia or high myopia.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 4741 students with or without myopia in either grade 1 for the primary school cohort (mean [SD] age 7.2 [0.4] years; 932 of 1975 [47.2%] female) or grade 7 for the junior high school cohort (mean [SD] age 13.2 [0.5] years; 1254 of 2670 [47.0%] female) were included. Baseline mean (SD) SER was 0.31 (0.86) D among 1975 students in grade 1 vs -1.60 (2.00) D among 2670 students in grade 7. Baseline prevalence of myopia was 12.0% in grade 1 students (n = 237 of 1969) and 67.4% in grade 7 students (n = 1795 of 2663). The incidence of myopia was 20% to 30% each year throughout both cohorts. The incidence of high myopia was initially less than 1% in the primary school cohort (grade 1: n = 2 of 1825; 0.1% [95% CI, 0.0%-0.3%]), but incidence exceeded 2% in the junior high school cohort (in grade 9: n = 48 of 2044; 2.3% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.7%]).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The incidence of myopia among Chinese students based on refraction without cycloplegia is among the highest of any cultural or ethnic group. If confirmed with cycloplegic refraction, interventions to prevent myopia onset in Chinese populations should be initiated in primary schools.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To characterize the choriocapillaris (CC) in highly myopic eyes with myopic maculopathy, using optical coherence tomographic angiography.\n",
      "METHODS: Prospective, clinic-based study of 42 eyes of 38 patients with high myopia (≤-6 diopters and axial length ≥26.5 mm). Myopic maculopathy was graded from fundus photographs according to the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia classification. Macular 3 × 3 mm en face optical coherence tomographic angiographic images were obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomographic angiography and graded for CC flow impairment as follows: 1) intact CC, 2) focal (<1 mm), and 3) extensive (>1 mm).\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 42 eyes, 17 (39.5%) had tessellated fundus, 20 (46.5%) had diffuse, and 6 (14.0%) had patchy atrophy. Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in all eyes with diffuse and patchy atrophy. Even in eyes with tessellated fundus only, CC signal voids were seen in 3 eyes (17.6%). With increasingly severe myopic maculopathy, the pattern of CC flow impairment changed from predominantly focal to predominantly extensive.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in many highly myopic eyes, even in those with mild fundus changes, and worsened with increasing severity of myopic maculopathy. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether CC flow impairment predicts the risk of myopic maculopathy progression.\n"

      " Association of Retinal Neurodegeneration on Optical Coherence Tomography With Dementia: A Population-Based Study.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Retinal structures may serve as a biomarker for dementia, but longitudinal studies examining this link are lacking.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of inner retinal layer thickness with prevalent and incident dementia in a general population of Dutch adults.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From September 2007 to June 2012, participants from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study who were 45 years and older and had gradable retinal optical coherence tomography images and at baseline were free from stroke, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinopathy, myopia, hyperopia, and optic disc pathology were included. They were followed up until January 1, 2015, for the onset of dementia.\n",
      "EXPOSURES: Inner retinal layer thicknesses (ie, retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL]) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thicknesses measured on optical coherence tomography images.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Odds ratios and hazard ratios for incident dementia per SD decrease in retinal layer thickness adjusted for age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 5065 individuals eligible for optical coherence tomography scanning, 3289 (64.9%) (mean [SD] age 68.9 [9.9] years, 1879 [57%] women) were included in the analysis. Of these 3289 individuals, 41 (1.2%) already had dementia. Thinner GC-IPL was associated with prevalent dementia (odds ratio per SD decrease in GC-IPL, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.99-1.90]). No association was found of RNFL with prevalent dementia. During 14 674 person-years of follow-up (mean [SD], 4.5 [1.6] years), 86 individuals (2.6%) developed dementia of whom 68 (2.1%) had Alzheimer disease. Thinner RNFL at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio per SD decrease in RNFL, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.19-1.75]), which was similar for Alzheimer disease (hazard ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.15-1.78]). No association was found between GC-IPL thickness and incident dementia (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.90-1.43]).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Thinner RNFL is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, suggesting that retinal neurodegeneration may serve as a preclinical biomarker for dementia.\n",

      " A Review of Current Concepts of the Etiology and Treatment of Myopia.\n",
      "Myopia occurs in more than 50% of the population in many industrialized countries and is expected to increase; complications associated with axial elongation from myopia are the sixth leading cause of blindness. Thus, understanding its etiology, epidemiology, and the results of various treatment regiments may modify current care and result in a reduction in morbidity from progressive myopia. This rapid increase cannot be explained by genetics alone. Current animal and human research demonstrates that myopia development is a result of the interplay between genetic and the environmental factors. The prevalence of myopia is higher in individuals whose both parents are myopic, suggesting that genetic factors are clearly involved in myopia development. At the same time, population studies suggest that development of myopia is associated with education and the amount time spent doing near work; hence, activities increase the exposure to optical blur. Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to slow the progression of myopia because of its relationship to the development of serious pathological conditions such as macular degeneration, retinal detachments, glaucoma, and cataracts. We reviewed meta-analysis and other of current treatments that include: atropine, progressive addition spectacle lenses, orthokeratology, and multifocal contact lenses.\n"

      " Usability of the Ranibizumab 0.5 mg Prefilled Syringe: Human Factors Studies to Evaluate Critical Task Completion by Healthcare Professionals.\n",
      "PURPOSE: A ranibizumab prefilled syringe (PFS) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Here we evaluate the use of the ranibizumab PFS for intravitreal injection by assessing whether the PFS enables healthcare providers to successfully prepare and administer an injection without prior training.\n",
      "DESIGN: Simulated-use and actual-use human factors usability studies.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Retina specialists and ophthalmic medical personnel.\n",
      "METHODS: In a simulated-use summative usability study, retina specialists (n = 15) and ophthalmic medical personnel (n = 15) prepared the ranibizumab PFS and performed injections into a model eye. In an actual-use formative usability study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02698566), three assistants and three retina specialists prepared the PFS and performed intravitreal injections, respectively, in study eyes of patients with retinal diseases (n = 35).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twelve tasks specific to the unpacking, preparing, and properly administering the PFS for intravitreal injection were evaluated by a study assessor. Task performances were evaluated for use errors, close calls, and operational difficulties. Post-injection subjective user evaluations were performed to assess ease of use.\n",
      "RESULTS: All participants successfully performed all essential and safety-critical tasks without use error in both the simulated-use and actual-use human factors usability studies. The majority of participants rated the tasks required to use the ranibizumab PFS as \"Easy\" or \"Very Easy.\"\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Both the simulated-use and actual-use usability studies yielded consistent data, showing that healthcare professionals are able to use the ranibizumab PFS by successfully performing all critical tasks involved in preparing and delivering an intravitreal injection. The simulated-use usability testing was sufficiently realistic and representative of real-world use, and was appropriate and preferred over actual-use usability testing for proper evaluation of the product user interface.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To determine predictive factors of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) formation after uncomplicated primary retinal detachment repair.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, case-control study of 74 consecutive patients with (37 eyes) and without (37 eyes) PVR formation after undergoing uncomplicated primary surgery for retinal detachment repair. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with PVR formation.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinal detachment involving the macula was 4.2 times (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-12.9; P = 0.0119) more likely to have PVR formation compared with those without. Patients who were current or former smokers were 3.6 times (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-11.7; P = 0.0352) more likely to have PVR formation compared with nonsmokers. Compared with 25-gauge (g) vitrectomy, larger gauge vitrectomy (20 g or 23 g) was 3.6 times (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-11.3; P = 0.0276) more likely to have PVR formation. Duration of retinal detachment symptoms, high myopia, lens status, lattice degeneration, location of retinal break, number of retinal breaks, and surgical technique (e.g., scleral buckle with or without vitrectomy versus vitrectomy alone) were not found to be predictive of PVR formation.\n",

      " Evidence for an Association between Macular Degeneration and Thyroid Cancer in the Aged Population.\n",
      "Direct evidence of whether thyroid cancer patients have a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has yet to be investigated. Patients older than 50 years-old and newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 2000 and 2008 were identified from the national health insurance research database (NHIRD). We applied time-varying Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association between thyroid cancer and AMD. The multivariable models included conventional cardiovascular risk factors, myopia, vitreous floaters, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and treatment modality of thyroid cancer. The analysis process was stratified by age, gender, and comorbidity. In this study, 5253 patients were included in a thyroid cancer cohort (men 24.5%; median age 59.1 years (53.7⁻67.4 years), and 21,012 matched controls were included in a non-thyroid cancer cohort. The AMD incidence was 40.7 per 10,000 person/year in the thyroid cancer cohort. The thyroid cancer cohort had a higher risk (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.38, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.09⁻1.75) of AMD than the non-thyroid cohort. Thyroid cancer patients had a higher risk of AMD, especially the male patients (aHR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.38⁻3.14) and the patients with comorbidities (aHR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.09⁻1.74). In conclusion, thyroid cancer patients older than 50 years-old have increased risk of AMD.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Data from Turkey show that sense organ diseases were the second leading cause of years lost due to disability in 2015. However, there are no reliable data on either the baseline causative disorders of visual impairment or the burden of these disorders on the population in Izmir region. Izmir is the third most populated city of Turkey with a population of approximately 4.2 million.\n",
      "AIM: The purpose of this study was to define the baseline disorders causing low vision and blindness in accordance with World Health Organization criteria in an adult population in Izmir.\n",
      "METHODS: We evaluated the ophthalmologic reports of 20 790 people in Izmir, Turkey. Age- and sex-specific causes of low vision and blindness were identified.\n",
      "RESULTS: Bilateral low vision and blindness was detected in 347 people, 172 males and 175 females. For those aged 18-50 years, retinal dystrophies (37%), congenital eye anomalies (14%) and myopic degenerations (13%) were the most common causes. For those aged 50+ years, age-related macular degeneration (21%) was the leading cause. Diabetic retinopathy (17%), corneal opacities (14%), cataract (12%) and glaucoma (9%) were also important.

      "PURPOSE: To provide the clinical recommendations for the administration of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs especially bavacizumab for ocular vascular diseases including diabetic macular edema, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, myopic choroidal neovascularization, retinal vein occlusion and central serous chorioretinopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: Twenty clinical questions were developed by the guideline technical committee. Relevant websites and databases were searched to find out the pertinent clinical practice guidelines to answer the questions. The technical committee provided possible answers (scenarios) according to the available evidences for each question. All scenarios along with their levels of evidence and the supported articles were sent to the experts for external review. If the experts did not agree on any of the scenarios for one particular clinical question, the technical committee reviewed all scenarios and their pertinent evidences and made the necessary decision. After that, the experts were asked to score them again. All confirmed scenarios were gathered as the final recommendations.\n",
      "RESULTS: All the experts agreed on at least one of the scenarios. The technical committee extracted the agreed scenario for each clinical question as the final recommendation. Finally, 56 recommendations were developed for the procedure of intravitreal anti-VEGF injection and their applications in the management of ocular vascular diseases.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The implementation of this guideline can standardize the management of the common ocular vascular diseases by intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. It can lead to better policy-making and evidence-based clinical decision by ophthalmologists and optimal evidence based eye care for patients.\n"

      " A Review of Myopia Control with Atropine.\n",
      "Myopia is a global public health issue with a worldwide prevalence of ∼30% and is estimated to rise to 50% by 2050. In addition to the burden associated with routine management of the condition, high myopia predisposes the eye to sight-threatening complications such as myopic maculopathy and glaucoma in adult life. Controlling onset and progression of myopia at a young age can reduce the risk of morbidity associated with high myopia. Progression of myopia can be slowed with various optical, environmental, and pharmaceutical strategies, of which atropine has proven to be the most effective. High-dose atropine (0.5%-1%) is the most effective, but it has significant trade-offs with respect to rebound of myopia on discontinuation and side effects such as photophobia and difficulty with near work (decreased accommodation). Low doses of atropine have been trialed and show a dose-dependent efficacy. However, its mode of action on the ocular tissues leading to slowing eye growth remains unclear and multiple mechanisms and sites in the eye have been postulated to play a role. This review summarizes the role of atropine in controlling myopia and the mechanisms studied to date.\n",

      " Global prevalence of visual impairment associated with myopic macular degeneration and temporal trends from 2000 through 2050: systematic review, meta-analysis and modelling.\n",
      "PURPOSE: We used systematic review and meta-analysis to identify and assimilate evidence quantifying blindness and visual impairment (VI) associated with myopic macular degeneration (MMD), then derived models to predict global patterns. The models were used to estimate the global prevalence of blindness and VI associated with MMD from 2000 to 2050.\n",
      "METHODS: The systematic review identified 17 papers with prevalence data for MMD VI fitting our inclusion criteria. Data from six papers with age-specific data were scaled to relative age-dependent risk and meta-analysed at VI and blindness levels. We analysed variance in all MMD VI and blindness data as a proportion of high myopia against variables from the place and year of data collection, with a model based on health expenditure providing the best correlation. We used this model to estimate the prevalence and number of people with MMD VI in each country in each decade.\n",
      "RESULTS: We included data from 17 studies comprising 137 514 participants. We estimated 10.0 million people had VI from MMD in 2015 (prevalence 0.13%, 95% CI 5.5 to 23.7 million, 0.07% to 0.34%), 3.3 million of whom were blind (0.04%, 1.8 to 7.8 million, 0.03% to 0.10%). We estimate that by 2050, without changing current interventions, VI from MMD will grow to 55.7 million people (0.57%, 29.0 to 119.7 million, 0.33% to 1.11%), 18.5 million of whom will be blind (0.19%, 9.6 to 39.7 million, 0.11% to 0.37%).\n",

      "PURPOSE: To determine the cumulative five-year incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in a rural Chinese adult population.\n",
      "METHODS: The Handan Eye Study was a population-based longitudinal study. In 2006, 6830 subjects aged 30+ years participated in this study (baseline). Five years later, 5394 subjects (follow-up rate: 85.3%) took part in the follow-up study. Participants had a detailed eye examination, including visual acuity, standardized refraction and fundus photography according to a similar protocol at both baseline and follow-up. Myopic maculopathy was defined as any of the following signs: diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, lacquer cracks and myopic choroidal neovascularization at the posterior pole. Parapapillary atrophy was assessed separately.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 5394 participants, 5078 (10 021 eyes) had gradable fundus photographs. Over the five years, four participants (five eyes) developed new myopic maculopathy, with an eye-specific incidence of 0.05% (95% CI, 0.02-0.10%). Among the 51 eyes with myopic maculopathy at baseline, the progression occurred in 18 eyes (35.3%), with new signs of patchy chorioretinal atrophy in 11 eyes (21.6%), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy in seven eyes (13.7%), lacquer cracks in three eyes (6.9%), macular atrophy in three eyes (6.9%) and myopic choroidal neovascularization in two eyes (3.9%). By multivariable analysis, female gender (OR, 9.14; p = 0.004) and higher educational level (OR, 8.24; p = 0.004) were associated with a higher risk of progression of myopic maculopathy, whereas lower myopia at baseline (OR, 0.79; p < 0.0001) and hypertension (OR, 0.21; p = 0.017) were associated with a reduced risk.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The five-year incidence of myopic maculopathy was 0.05% in rural Chinese adults aged 30+ years. The progression rate in participants with myopic maculopathy was 35.3%, indicating the importance of regular follow-up for these patients.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to etiologies other than age-related macular degeneration and pathologic myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and CENTRAL.\n",
      "RESULTS: The search identified 5 RCTs; no relevant observational studies were identified. The studies differed in terms of underlying cause of CNV, patient numbers (n = 9-178), follow-up time (2-36 months) and quality assessment. In the largest RCT (n = 178 across a range of rare CNV etiologies), intravitreal ranibizumab showed superior efficacy versus sham from baseline to month 2 [mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): + 9.5 vs. - 0.4 letters; p < 0.001]; the gain was maintained up to month 12. In the treatment of CNV secondary to presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), both intravitreal ranibizumab and photodynamic therapy (PDT) showed significant improvement from baseline BCVA over the 12-month period (n = 9); however, all patients in the PDT group required rescue ranibizumab therapy. Unlicensed intravitreal bevacizumab was associated with a statistically significant improvement in BCVA compared to PDT at 12 months (p < 0.001) in patients with CNV secondary to multifocal choroiditis (n = 27). The use of steroids before PDT showed better BCVA outcomes than PDT alone (p < 0.05) in patients with idiopathic CNV (n = 20). Argon green laser therapy showed limited efficacy in patients with CNV secondary to OHS (n = 134).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: There is evidence from a relatively large, good-quality study to support the use of intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of CNV secondary to rare diseases. However, the limited number of RCTs for this indication and differences in study characteristics between RCTs mean that there is uncertainty regarding comparative clinical effectiveness of interventions. RCTs with an active comparator are required to fully establish the comparative effectiveness of treatments for CNV secondary to rare diseases.\n",

      "Dedifferentiation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have crucial roles in AMD onset and progression. We thus aim to investigate the effects of miRNAs on RPE dedifferentiation and endothelium cell (EC) behavior, and analyze its downstream pathways. We have previously identified miR-302d-3p as the most downregulated miRNA signature along with RPE differentiation. Herein, in vitro study supported that miR-302d-3p induces RPE dedifferentiation typified by reduction of RPE characteristic markers, interrupts its phagocytosis, and promotes its migration, proliferation, and cell-cycle progression. c-Jun was identified as a potential upstream transcript factor for MIR302D, which might modulate RPE function by regulating miR-302d-3p expression.

      "RESULTS: Of 110 highly myopic eyes (70 individuals) at baseline, 39 eyes (35.5%) showed progression observed in 15 of 79 eyes (19%) with tessellated fundus at baseline, in 17 of 24 eyes (71%) with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, in all 6 eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and the 1 eye with macular atrophy. Lacquer cracks detected in 2 eyes in 2001 developed into a small patchy atrophy (1 eye) or widened during the follow-up (1 eye). Five eyes demonstrated new lacquer cracks. In binary regression analysis, progression of myopic maculopathy was associated with longer axial length (P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 7.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.49-20.4), older age (P = 0.001; OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.42), higher prevalence of staphylomas (P = 0.03; OR, 24.3; 95% CI, 2.89-204), smaller parapapillary γ-zone in 2011 (P = 0.01; OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91), and female gender (P = 0.04; OR, 9.78; 95% CI, 1.06-90.6).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The 10-year progression rate of myopic maculopathy in this elderly Chinese population was 35.5%, increasing from 15 of 79 eyes (19%) in category 1 of myopic maculopathy at baseline to 17 of 24 eyes (71%) in category 2 and 6 of 6 eyes (100%) in category 3. Risk factors for myopic maculopathy progression were longer axial length, pre-existing staphylomata, smaller parapapillary γ-zone, older age, and female gender.\n"

      " The use of optical coherence tomography angiography for detecting choroidal neovascularization, compared to standard multimodal imaging.\n",
      "PurposeTo assess OCT angiography (OCTA) effectiveness at detecting choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in cases of suspected neovascular age related macular degeneration (nAMD), chronic central serous retinopathy (cCSR) and pathological myopia compared to FFA and how it compares to a multimodal approach (OCT, FFA and ICGA) for detecting the vascular network.MethodsThis was a retrospective observational cohort study of patients who had clinical and/or OCT findings suggestive of CNV, having further investigation with FFA, with or without ICG, and had same day OCTA using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT2 beta angiography module. Multimodal imaging interpretation was compared to OCTA images. OCTA images were also analysed for inter-rater reliability (using kappa statistic). The diagnostic accuracy of OCTA was compared to FFA (using Cochran's Q, p<0.05). OCTA was also compared to a multimodal approach in defining a vascular network.ResultsOverall sensitivity of OCTA compared to FFA was 71% and specificity of 81% (p=0.108). Subgroup analysis for OCTA vs FFA for detecting classic nAMD/type II CNV sensitivity was 100% and specificity of 76% (p<0.05). OCTA vs FFA for detecting occult nAMD/type-I CNV sensitivity was 47% and specificity of 76%, (p=0.248). OCTA was better than FFA at defining a vascular network overall, when OCT was suspicious (59% vs 49%).ConclusionsOCTA was better at detecting classic nAMD/type II CNV compared to FFA and for defining a vascular network in nAMD compared to FFA and ICGA. It was able to aid in making the diagnosis in cases where evidence of CNV was uncertain following FFA/ICGA.\n"

      " Macular buckle technique in myopic traction maculopathy: a 16-year review of the literature and a comparison with vitreous surgery.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to review anatomical and functional outcomes following macular buckling (MB) in high myopia and to compare such results with those obtained by pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).\n",
      "METHODS: PubMed articles on MB in high myopia (2000-2016) were reviewed. Main outcomes included retinal reattachment and macular hole (MH) closure rates, resolution of myopic foveoschisis (MFS), and postoperative visual acuity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Thirty-one articles included 16 in patients with retinal detachment due to MH (MHRD group), 11 in MFS with or without foveal detachment (MFS group), and 4 in MH patients with MFS (MH-MFS group). Surgical techniques mainly differed in the type of buckle, rectus muscles involvement, and concurrent PPV. In eyes with persistent MH, prognosis in the MHRD and MH-MFS groups differed between eyes receiving MB compared to PPV: functional outcome was markedly poorer and there was a higher risk of retinal redetachment associated with PPV. In the MSF group, secondary MHs were more likely to develop in eyes treated with PPV and internal limiting membrane peeling than those undergoing MB alone or combined with PPV. Retinal pigment epithelium changes, malpositioning, perforation, and choroidal detachment were the main complications.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Although different approaches are used, complete resolution of foveoschisis, retinal reattachment, and MH closure seem to be achieved more frequently with MB than PPV.\n",

      " Peripheral retinal changes in highly myopic young Asian eyes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine the type and prevalence of peripheral retinal changes and its relationship with axial length (AL) in a population of young Asian adult males.\n",
      "METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of male subjects aged between 19 and 25 years old. High myopes [spherical equivalent refraction, (SER) < -6.00 D] were recruited and underwent further ocular investigations including dilated retinal photography and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy by two trained ophthalmologists. The frequency of peripheral retinal changes within high myopes was correlated with axial length and also compared with a group of emmetropes (SER between -0.50 D and +1.00 D).\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 593 high myopes and 156 emmetropes were recruited. White without pressure (WWOP; n = 458, 46.5%) and lattice degeneration (LD; n = 109, 14.6%) were the commonest findings, and their prevalence was significantly higher among high myopes (LD, 16.9% versus 5.8%; WWOP, 57.2% versus 5.8%; both p < 0.001). Among high myopes, temporal LD was more common (71%) and 35% had more than one area in the same eye. Increasing AL was associated with LD (odds ratio 1.28, p = 0.01) and retinal holes (odd's ratio 1.44, p = 0.02) on multivariate analysis.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: White without pressure (WWOP) and LD were the commonest peripheral retinal changes. One-third of high myopes with LD had more than one area in the same eye. Increasing AL was associated with LD and retinal holes. Studies in older adults should be conducted to develop clinical guidelines for the management of high myopes.\n"

      " Clinical applications of optical coherence tomography angiography: What we have learnt in the first 3 years.\n",
      "A review of the literature from 2014 to 2016 was conducted, focusing on the results of optical coherence tomography angiography in different chorioretinal diseases. In only 3 years, optical coherence tomography angiography has been shown to be an effective tool for diagnosing choroidal neovascularization complicating age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, and inflammatory conditions. The technique has sometimes been considered superior to conventional multimodal imaging, for example, in choroidal neovascularization associated with chronic central serous chorioretinopathy or multifocal choroiditis. In retinal vascular diseases, optical coherence tomography angiography has helped to understand the condition described as paracentral acute middle maculopathy and has been considered highly effective for the analysis of retinal vascular macular changes secondary to retinal vein occlusion or macular telangiectasia. Changes in the foveal avascular zone, also reported in diabetic maculopathy, have been shown to occur before any angiographic signs. A reduction in capillary vascular density has been reported in the fovea of eyes with malignant melanoma, but not in eyes with choroidal nevus. However, optical coherence tomography angiography is a recent technique that probably needs refinements and further studies. Nevertheless, the first 3 years of optical coherence tomography angiography use suggest its clinical relevance and useful applications in daily clinical practice.\n",

      " Prevalence and causes of vision loss in high-income countries and in Eastern and Central Europe in 2015: magnitude, temporal trends and projections.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Within a surveillance of the prevalence and causes of vision impairment in high-income regions and Central/Eastern Europe, we update figures through 2015 and forecast expected values in 2020.\n",
      "METHODS: Based on a systematic review of medical literature, prevalence of blindness, moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI), mild vision impairment and presbyopia was estimated for 1990, 2010, 2015, and 2020.\n",
      "RESULTS: Age-standardised prevalence of blindness and MSVI for all ages decreased from 1990 to 2015 from 0.26% (0.10-0.46) to 0.15% (0.06-0.26) and from 1.74% (0.76-2.94) to 1.27% (0.55-2.17), respectively. In 2015, the number of individuals affected by blindness, MSVI and mild vision impairment ranged from 70 000, 630 000 and 610 000, respectively, in Australasia to 980 000, 7.46 million and 7.25 million, respectively, in North America and 1.16 million, 9.61 million and 9.47 million, respectively, in Western Europe. In 2015, cataract was the most common cause for blindness, followed by age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, uncorrected refractive error, diabetic retinopathy and cornea-related disorders, with declining burden from cataract and AMD over time. Uncorrected refractive error was the leading cause of MSVI.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: While continuing to advance control of cataract and AMD as the leading causes of blindness remains a high priority, overcoming barriers to uptake of refractive error services would address approximately half of the MSVI burden. New data on burden of presbyopia identify this entity as an important public health problem in this population. Additional research on better treatments, better implementation with existing tools and ongoing surveillance of the problem is needed.\n"

      "PURPOSE: Low birth weight (BW) is linked to impaired organ development in childhood, including altered ocular morphological and functional development. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether low BW has long-term effects on visual acuity and refraction in adulthood.\n",
      "METHODS: The Gutenberg Health Study is a population-based, observational cohort study in Germany, including 15 010 participants aged between 35 and 74 years. These participants were divided into three different BW groups (low: <2500 g; normal: between 2500 and 4000 g; and high: >4000 g). Best-corrected visual acuity and objective refraction were examined. We used multivariable linear regression models with adjustment for age, sex, socioeconomic status and self-reported glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, corneal disease and cataract to assess associations between BW and the main outcome measures, best-corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent and astigmatism.\n",
      "RESULTS: Overall, 8369 participants reported their BW. In a multivariable analysis, an association for low BW with spherical equivalent (B=-0.28 per dioptre, P=0.005) and best-corrected visual acuity (B=0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, P=0.006) compared with normal BW was observed. For participants with high BW, an association was observed with spherical equivalent (B=0.29 per dioptre, P<0.001), while none with visual acuity.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that low BW is linked to visual acuity and refractive long-term outcomes long after childhood. Individuals with low BW are more likely to have lower visual acuity and a higher myopic refractive error in adulthood. Adults with high BW are more likely to have a more hyperopic refractive error.\n"

      "AIMS: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents effectively treat age-related macular degeneration and myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a fibrinolytic compound, is used as an adjuvant to displace submacular hemorrhage and to treat type 2 CNV. The purpose of this study was to investigate in in vitro and in vivo experiments the antiangiogenic impact of tPA itself.\n",
      "METHODS: The impact of tPA on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was assessed by an XTT assay [2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide]. A basic fibroblast growth factor-impregnated gelatin hydrogel sheet was implanted into the rabbit cornea to induce corneal neovascularization. Immediately postoperatively, tPA or buffered saline solution (control) was injected intravitreally.\n",
      "RESULTS: The growth and viability of the HUVECs were unaffected by tPA at clinical concentrations. In the control group, the mean lengths of the new vessels were 1.0 ± 0.41, 1.6 ± 0.75, and 3.6 ± 2.1 mm at weeks 1, 2, and 4, respectively. In contrast, tPA significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the corneal neovascularization.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Although tPA has no direct impact on the vascular endothelial cells in vitro, the fibrinolytic effects of tPA might markedly suppress neovascularization in vivo.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To examine frequency and associations of retinal hemorrhages.\n",
      "METHODS: The population-based Beijing Eye Study included 3,468 individuals. Monoscopic fundus photographs were examined for hemorrhages.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinal hemorrhages were detected in 515 eyes (429 individuals) (prevalence: 7.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.0-8.0 per eye; 12.7%; 95% CI: 11.7-13.7 per person). Higher prevalence of retinal hemorrhages was correlated (multivariate analysis) with higher systolic blood pressure (P < 0.001; odds ratio: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), higher prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (P < 0.001; odds ratio: 121; 95% CI: 61-240), and higher prevalence of retinal vein occlusions (P < 0.001; odds ratio: 27; 95% CI: 17-42). Retinal hemorrhages were due to diabetic retinopathy (189 [36.7%] eyes), retinal vein occlusions (n = 65 [12.6%]), posterior vitreous detachment (n = 23 [4.5%]), glaucoma (n = 14 [2.7%]), exudative age-related macular degeneration (n = 8 [1.6%]), hypertensive retinopathy (n = 10 [1.9%]), and exudative myopic maculopathy (n = 1 [0.2%]). Retinal hemorrhages without evident ocular cause (\"NOH\") were detected in 204 (3.0%) eyes (or 39.6% of all retinal hemorrhages). Higher prevalence of NOHs was correlated with higher systolic blood pressure (P < 0.001; odds ratio: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03) after adjusting for blood glucose concentration and prevalence of cortical cataract.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In a population-based recruited cohort of individuals aged 50+ years, prevalence of any fundus hemorrhage was about 8% per eye and 13% per individual. Approximately 60% of the hemorrhages were due to ocular reasons, mainly diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, and posterior vitreous detachment, whereas 40% of the bleedings were not evidently associated with ophthalmologic causes but strongly with elevated systolic blood pressure.\n",

      "DESIGN: A deep learning system for the classification of GON was developed for automated classification of GON on color fundus photographs.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively included 48 116 fundus photographs for the development and validation of a deep learning algorithm.\n",
      "METHODS: This study recruited 21 trained ophthalmologists to classify the photographs. Referable GON was defined as vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7 or more and other typical changes of GON. The reference standard was made until 3 graders achieved agreement. A separate validation dataset of 8000 fully gradable fundus photographs was used to assess the performance of this algorithm.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) with sensitivity and specificity was applied to evaluate the efficacy of the deep learning algorithm detecting referable GON.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the validation dataset, this deep learning system achieved an AUC of 0.986 with sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 92.0%. The most common reasons for false-negative grading (n = 87) were GON with coexisting eye conditions (n = 44 [50.6%]), including pathologic or high myopia (n = 37 [42.6%]), diabetic retinopathy (n = 4 [4.6%]), and age-related macular degeneration (n = 3 [3.4%]). The leading reason for false-positive results (n = 480) was having other eye conditions (n = 458 [95.4%]), mainly including physiologic cupping (n = 267 [55.6%]). Misclassification as false-positive results amidst a normal-appearing fundus occurred in only 22 eyes (4.6%).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning system can detect referable GON with high sensitivity and specificity. Coexistence of high or pathologic myopia is the most common cause resulting in false-negative results. Physiologic cupping and pathologic myopia were the most common reasons for false-positive results.\n"

      " Projection of Eye Disease Burden in Singapore.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Singapore's ageing population is likely to see an increase in chronic eye conditions in the future. This study aimed to estimate the burden of eye diseases among resident Singaporeans stratified for age and ethnicity by 2040.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prevalence data on myopia, epiretinal membrane (ERM), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), age macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), cataract, glaucoma and refractive error (RE) by age cohorts and educational attainment from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study were applied to population estimates from the Singapore population model.\n",
      "RESULTS: All eye conditions are projected to increase by 2040. Myopia and RE will remain the most prevalent condition, at 2.393 million (2.32 to 2.41 million) cases, representing a 58% increase from 2015. It is followed by cataract and ERM, with 1.33 million (1.31 to 1.35 million), representing an 81% increase, and 0.54 million (0.53 to 0.549 million) cases representing a 97% increase, respectively. Eye conditions that will see the greatest increase from 2015 to 2040 in the Chinese are: DR (112%), glaucoma (100%) and ERM (91.4%). For Malays, DR (154%), ERM (136%), and cataract (122%) cases are expected to increase the most while for Indians, ERM (112%), AMD (101%), and cataract (87%) are estimated to increase the most in the same period.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Results indicate that the burden for all eye diseases is expected to increase significantly into the future, but at different rates. These projections can facilitate the planning efforts of both policymakers and healthcare providers in the development and provision of infrastructure and resources to adequately meet the eye care needs of the population. By stratifying for age and ethnicity, high risk groups may be identified and targeted interventions may be implemented.\n"

      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate macular choroidal thickness (CT) and retinal thickness in Turkish patients with high myopia without maculopathy and in normal subjects and to examine the association with age, axial length (AL), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), cycloplegic refraction, and spherical equivalent (SE).\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective study was performed between January 2015 and June 2016 in the Department of Ophthalmology, Duzce University Medical Faculty. It had 65 individuals (30 patients with high myopia, 35 healthy subjects). Retinal and choroidal images were obtained using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Measurements (one subfoveal, three temporal, three nasal) were taken at 500 μm intervals up to 1,500 μm using the caliper system. Only the right eye was used for subsequent analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age was 29.5 ± 14.5 years and 25.6 ± 7.0 in the high myopia and control groups, respectively. The subfoveal CT was significantly lower in the high myopia group (mean, 218.3 ± 102.25 mm) than the control group (mean, 331.83 ± 99.06 mm; p < 0.001). In both groups, the choroid was thinnest at the nasal 1,500 μm location, being 158.40 ± 90.8 μm and 301 ± 103.59 μm, respectively. Retinal thickness in both groups was thickest at the nasal 1,500 μm location and thinnest in the subfoveal region. In patients with high myopia, CT was negatively correlated with AL (r=-0.490, p=0.006) and age (r=-0.455, p=0.012).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Highly myopic eyes have a thinner choroid, which may be secondary to longer AL but is not an independent factor. Further studies in the field of OCT are important to exploring the pathology of high myopia.\n"

      "OBJECTIVE: To show morphologic and angiographic changes in the peripheral retina in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using wide-field fundus imaging, and to compare these findings with those from healthy controls.\n",
      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional clinical study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: In total, 152 patients with clinical AMD and 150 healthy controls (without AMD in either macula) were studied. Subjects were ≥50 years of age. Exclusion criteria were diabetic retinopathy, previous retinal surgery, high myopia, or dense cataract, as well as any retinal inflammatory, degenerative, or occlusive disease.\n",
      "METHODS: For both groups of patients, color fundus images were captured with the Optos P200 MA camera (Optos, Dunfermline, Scotland). Image analysis software was used to characterize each image. Angiography was performed on the AMD group only. Morphological and angiographic peripheral retinal changes were studied per the frequency of their occurrence, the affected peripheral retina (clock hours), and the localization of peripheral changes with regard to the eye equator. Statistical significance was defined at a level of P < 0.05.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Peripheral changes in both groups according to their type and frequency (percentage of eyes with detected retinal changes), the number of clock hours of affected peripheral retina, and their localization with regard to the equator of the eye.\n",
      "RESULTS: Drusen, reticular pigmentary changes, and paving stone degeneration occurred more frequently in the AMD group than in controls (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001 respectively), whereas white without pressure occurred more frequently in the control group (P = 0.027). In both groups, peripheral retinal changes were observed peripheral to the equator in more than 40% of analyzed eyes. In control Croatian subjects, peripheral drusen were seen in 38% of subjects compared with 68% of AMD subjects.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Drusen, reticular pigmentary change , and paving stone degeneration occur significantly more frequently in subjects with AMD compared with controls. White without pressure degeneration was present in a high percentage of control subjects.\n"

      " Analysis combining correlated glaucoma traits identifies five new risk loci for open-angle glaucoma.\n",
      "Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. To identify new risk loci for OAG, we performed a genome-wide association study in 3,071 OAG cases and 6,750 unscreened controls, and meta-analysed the results with GWAS data for intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic disc parameters (the overall meta-analysis sample size varying between 32,000 to 48,000 participants), which are glaucoma-related traits. We identified and independently validated four novel genome-wide significant associations within or near MYOF and CYP26A1, LINC02052 and CRYGS, LMX1B, and LMO7 using single variant tests, one additional locus (C9) using gene-based tests, and two genetic pathways - \"response to fluid shear stress\" and \"abnormal retina morphology\" - in pathway-based tests. Interestingly, some of the new risk loci contribute to risk of other genetically-correlated eye diseases including myopia and age-related macular degeneration. To our knowledge, this study is the first integrative study to combine genetic data from OAG and its correlated traits to identify new risk variants and genetic pathways, highlighting the future potential of combining genetic data from genetically-correlated eye traits for the purpose of gene discovery and mapping.\n",

      " Morphological analysis and quantitative evaluation of myopic maculopathy by three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging.\n",
      "PurposeTo study the characteristic morphology and quantitatively evaluate the eye shape in different types of myopic maculopathy.MethodsA total of 103 eyes from 65 patients with high myopic maculopathy were examined by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI). The participants were classified into two groups, namely myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) eyes and non-MTM eyes, with SD-OCT imaging. Volume renderings and morphology analysis of the 3D MRI of the eyeball were obtained. Quantitative analysis was achieved in the calculation of vitreous volume and the three-dimensional diameters of the eyeball in three cardinal axes. The eye shape distribution and the diameters of the eyeball were compared between the two groups. Eye shape distribution, vitreous volume, and eyeball diameter were compared between MTM and non-MTM eyes.ResultsThe MTM and non-MTM groups had a total of 68 and 35 eyes, respectively. A significant difference was found in the eye shape distribution (P<0.0001) between MTM and non-MTM eyes. Most of the MTM eyes had undergone a non-uniform expansion of the eyeball, whereas the non-MTM eyes had expanded uniformly. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in either vitreous volume or other diameters between the two groups.ConclusionsNon-uniform globe expansion and staphyloma formation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of MTM.\n"

      " Myopia in Chinese families shows linkage to 10q26.13.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine genetic linkage between myopia and Han Chinese patients with a family history of the disease.\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred seventy-six Han Chinese patients from 34 extended families were given eye examinations, and mean spherical equivalent (MSE) in diopters (D) was calculated by adding the spherical component of the refraction to one-half the cylindrical component and taking the average of both eyes. The MSE was converted to a binary phenotype, where all patients with an MSE of -1.00 D or less were coded as affected. Unaffected individuals had an MSE greater than 0.00 D (ages 21 years and up), +1.50 (ages 11-20), or +2.00 D (ages 6-10 years). Individuals between the given upper threshold and -1.00 were coded as unknown. Patients were genotyped on an exome chip. Three types of linkage analyses were performed: single-variant two-point, multipoint, and collapsed haplotype pattern (CHP) variant two-point.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To examine the progression pattern of myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Highly myopic patients who had been followed up for 10 years or more.\n",
      "METHODS: Using fundus photographs, myopic features were differentiated according to Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) Study Group recommendations.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progression pattern of maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 810 eyes of 432 patients (mean age, 42.3±16.8 years; mean axial length, 28.8±1.9 mm; mean follow-up, 18.7±7.1 years). The progression rate of myopic maculopathy was 47.0 per 1000 eye-years. Within the pathologic myopia (PM) group (n = 521 eyes), progression of myopic maculopathy was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.21; P = 0.001), older age (OR, 1.03; P = 0.002), longer axial length (OR, 1.20; P = 0.007), greater axial elongation (OR, 1.45; P = 0.005), and development of parapapillary atrophy (PPA; OR, 3.14; P < 0.001). Diffuse atrophy, found in 217 eyes without choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or lacquer cracks (LCs) at baseline, progressed in 111 (51%) eyes, leading to macular diffuse atrophy (n = 64; 64/111 or 58%), patchy atrophy (n = 59; 53%), myopic CNV (n = 18; 16%), LCs (n = 9; 5%), and patchy-related macular atrophy (n = 3; 3%). Patchy atrophy, detected in 63 eyes without CNV or LCs at baseline, showed progression in 60 eyes (95%), leading to enlargement of original patchy atrophy (n = 59; 59/60 or 98%), new patchy atrophy (n = 29; 48%), CNV-related macular atrophy (n = 13; 22%), and patchy-related macular atrophy (n = 5; 8%). Of 66 eyes with LCs, 43 eyes (65%) showed progression with development of new patchy atrophy (n = 38; 38/43 or 88%) and new LCs (n = 7; 16%). Reduction in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was associated mainly (all P < 0.001) with the development of CNV or CNV-related macular atrophy and enlargement of macular atrophy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent progression patterns were an extension of peripapillary diffuse atrophy to macular diffuse atrophy in diffuse atrophy, enlargement of the original atrophic lesion in patchy atrophy, and development of patchy atrophy in LCs. Main risk factors for progression were older age, longer axial length, and development of PPA.\n"

      " Longitudinal Changes in Disc and Retinal Lesions Among Highly Myopic Adolescents in Singapore Over a 10-Year Period.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To examine the progression pattern of disc and retinal lesions in highly myopic Chinese adolescents over a 10-year period in Singapore.\n",
      "METHODS: This longitudinal study included Chinese participants who showed high myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] worse than or equal to -5 diopters [D]), no history of refractive surgery, and available fundus photographs at both 2006 (baseline) and 2016 (10-year follow-up) visits. Forty-four adolescents (aged 12-16 years at baseline) who were re-examined later at follow-up were included. Cycloplegic refraction, biometry, and fundus photography were performed at both visits. A trained grader classified myopic macular degeneration (MMD) based on the Meta-pathologic myopia classification and disc lesions from fundus photographs. Choroidal thickness (CT) measurements were performed at 10-year follow-up using swept-source optical coherence tomography. The ocular parameters and lesions were compared between baseline and follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was a significant worsening of high myopia at follow-up to -7.5±1.8 D (mean SE±SD) in 2016 versus -6.2±1.3 D in 2006; (P<0.001). The 10-year changes included increased degree of tessellation (26 eyes, 29.5%), development of new tessellated fundus (19 eyes, 21.6%), disc tilt (7 eyes, 8.0%), and expansion of peripapillary atrophy size (33 eyes, 37.5%). Eyes with early-onset tessellation (present at baseline, 48 eyes) showed significantly thinner CT (P<0.05), compared with eyes with late-onset tessellation (incident at 10-year follow-up, 19 eyes). No cases of MMD were recorded at baseline or 10-year follow-up.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no incident MMD, the retinal and disc lesions worsened over the follow-up period. Early-onset fundus tessellation was associated with thinner CT.\n"

      " Prevalence and Causes of Visual Impairment in Adults in Binhu District, Wuxi, China.\n",
      "BACKGROUND Previously reported data has guided the treatment and prevention of blindness. This study aimed to evaluate the current prevalence and causes of visual impairment among adults who were 50 years old and older in the Binhu District of Wuxi City, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A randomized sample of stratified clusters was used to analyze individuals from 30 basic sampling units in Wuxi Binhu District. Visual impairment was defined according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. RESULTS A total of 6725 people who were at least 50 years old participated in this study. According to WHO standards, bilateral low vision and blindness prevalence were both higher in women than in men (low vision: 6.5% vs. 5.2%; and blindness: 1.4% vs. 0.8%; P=0.022 and P=0.039, respectively). The incidence of bilateral visual impairment increased significantly with age (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Further studies showed that the main causes of bilateral low vision were cataract, high myopic macular degeneration (MMD), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The main causes of bilateral blindness were cataract, MMD, and eye loss/atrophy, while the main causes of monocular low vision were cataract, MD, and AMD. The main causes of monocular blindness were cataract, eye loss/atrophy, and AMD. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of low vision and blindness remains high in the Binhu District of Wuxi City in China, especially among older women. In our study, cataracts were the leading cause of visual impairment. Our study highlights that some efforts should be initiated to prevent and treat blindness and low vision. Additional causes of visual impairment were MMD, AMD, and eye loss/atrophy.\n"

      " Macular Buckling Surgery for Retinal Detachment Associated with Macular Hole in High Myopia Eye.\n",
      "A 68-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a 1-month history of central scotoma and visual loss in her right eye. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motion in her right eye. Fundus examination showed myopic chorioretinal degeneration in association with posterior staphyloma and the retina was slightly elevated throughout the macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed retinal detachment involving the posterior pole with a macular hole and staphyloma. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, macular buckling, and perfluoropropane gas tamponade. At 3-month follow-up, her BCVA was improved to counting fingers at 1 meter and flattened retina with closed macular hole was observed by OCT. Myopic macular hole with retinal detachment associated with posterior staphyloma represent a challenge regarding their management and several surgical techniques have been described. Although satisfactory anatomical improvement is achieved in these eyes after surgery, the visual acuity outcomes may be poorer than expected due to the chorioretinal atrophy at the posterior pole.\n",

      " Assessment of Posterior Segment Using Spectral Domain OCT in Highly Myopic Eyes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate retinal and vitreo-retinal changes that occur in highly myopic patients.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective study included 472 eyes of 472 patients suffering from high myopia (> -6.00 D), between May 2012 and December 2015. All patients were examined, using Cirrus HD OCT (Zeiss Cirrus TM HD-OCT model 4000), to detect any retinal or vitreo-retinal interface abnormalities.All obtained data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and the paired two-sided t-test. Bivariate correlations were performed between different parameters using the Spearman correlation coefficient (r).\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean spherical equivalent (MSE) was -13.11± 4.35D. Mean axial length (AL) was 28.5±1.62 mm. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) was the most frequent OCT finding; representing 33.4% of the cases, 13.7% of them were associated with macular traction. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between AL and MTM, full thickness macular hole, PVD with traction, and dome shaped macula (r = 0.49 and P = 0.001, r = 0.422 and P = 0.0001, r = 0.25 and P = 0.03, r=0.475, P=0.001 respectively).\n",

      "PURPOSE: To retrospectively review the prevalence of myopia and elongated axial length in eyes with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and to evaluate treatment response of PCV in highly myopic eyes. PCV has rarely been reported in myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective review of all eyes diagnosed with PCV at the clinics of Retina Consultants of Hawaii and the Hawaii Macula and Retina Institute was performed between February of 2007 and April of 2017 to evaluate for eyes with significant myopia and elongated axial length.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 282 eyes were diagnosed with PCV by ICG angiography. There were 144 males (59%) and 99 females (41%). 204 patients had unilateral PCV and 39 patients had bilateral PCV. A total of 3 patients with PCV had significant myopia less than -6 diopters or confirmed elongated axial length. One of these patients had bilateral PCV so there were 4 eyes noted with significant myopia and elongated axial length out of 282 eyes with PCV (1.4%). All 3 patients were Asian and presented with active leakage or bleeding related to PCV diagnosed on indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography. Treatments typically used to treat PCV including intravitreal antiangiogenic medications and photodynamic therapy were utilized.\n",

      "PURPOSE: The study aimed to describe our initial experience with the use of anti vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs) in the treatment of retinal diseases.\n",
      "METHODS: The case records of all patients who had received at least 3 doses of intravitreal anti- VEGF injections between January 2012 to December 2016 were reviewed. Information culled from the data was age, sex, indications for treatment, type of injection, presenting visual acuity, post injection visual acuity, systemic and ocular co morbidities. Results were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0 for Windows statistical software.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 190 injections were given during the study period, to 58 eyes of 50 patients. Twenty-eight females (56.00%) and twenty-two males (44.00%) were seen with a mean age of 59.6± 11.66. Bevacizumab was the most frequently administered anti- VEGF, 142 (74.74%) while only 48(25.26%) injections of Ranibizumab were given. Three eyes had both bevacizumab and ranibizumab (1.58%). Retinal vein occlusion 61(32.11%) was the commonest indication for the injections followed by diabetic macular edema 43(22.63%) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy 42(22.11%). Others were neovascular age related macular degeneration, neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, myopic choroidal neovascularization and cystoid macular edema. There was an association between age and disease, (p = 0.001). There was an improvement in visual acuity after intervention in cases with retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema, and this was statistically significant. Hypertension was the commonest systemic disorder in this series 81(42.36%) and the supero-temporal quadrant 131(68.95%) was the most preferred position to administer the injection. Floaters was the commonest complication seen.\n",

      "METHODS: Medical records of RP patients were screened and 31 eyes with RD were included. Family history of RP, duration of symptoms, age at presentation, associated ocular and systemic findings, and detailed ophthalmic evaluation including presenting visual acuity, type and amount of refractive error, fundus findings, electroretinogram details, surgical details, and postoperative complications and outcomes were evaluated. Univariate analysis was done to determine risk factors associated with RD in eyes with RP and risk factors associated with poor visual outcomes after treatment. Subset analysis was also done for comparing the functional and anatomical outcomes between patients undergoing scleral buckling or vitrectomy.\n",
      "OUTCOME MEASURES: Final surgical reattachment rate, best-corrected visual acuity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 22 years (median, 17; range, 4-63). Mean duration of symptoms was 12 months (median, 3 months: range, 3 days-60 months). Associated ocular findings included nyctalopia (n = 23), myopia (n = 21), and hyperopia (n = 10). Systemic associations included hearing loss (n = 5), deaf-mutism (n = 1), and Bardet-Biedel syndrome (n = 1). No association between degree of myopia and RD was noted (P = 0.63). Observed retinal breaks included horse-shoe-shaped tear (n = 15), lattice with hole (n = 7), atrophic retinal hole (n = 3), retinal dialysis (n = 3), and macular hole (n = 3). The most common location of breaks was superotemporal quadrant (n = 15). Younger age, male gender, and presence of posterior vitreous detachment were strongly associated with RD with odds ratio of 1.3 (P = 0.001), 8.3 (P = 0.010), and 6 (P = 0.003), respectively. Retinal reattachment was achieved in 13 of 13 eyes (100%) with scleral buckle and 9 of 10 eyes (90%) with vitrectomy. Vision improved from 1.63±0.52 to 0.87±0.25 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (P < 0.001) at a mean follow-up of 33 months (median, 24, range; 1-145).\n",

      "PURPOSE: Microarray and RNA sequencing studies in the chick model of early optically induced refractive error have implicated thousands of genes, many of which have also been linked to ocular pathologies in humans, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), choroidal neovascularization, glaucoma, and cataract. These findings highlight the potential relevance of the chick model to understanding both refractive error development and the progression to secondary pathological complications. The present study aimed to determine whether proteomic responses to early optical defocus in the chick share similarities with these transcriptome-level changes, particularly in terms of dysregulation of pathology-related molecular processes.\n",
      "METHODS: Chicks were assigned to a lens condition (monocular +10 D [diopters] to induce hyperopia, -10 D to induce myopia, or no lens) on post-hatch day 5. Biometric measures were collected following a further 6 h and 48 h of rearing. The retina/RPE was then removed and prepared for liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) on an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite. Raw data were processed using MaxQuant, and differentially abundant proteins were identified using moderated \n",
      "RESULTS: Refractive errors of -2.63 D ± 0.31 D (mean ± standard error, SE) and 3.90 D ± 0.37 D were evident in the negative and positive lens groups, respectively, at 6 h. By 48 h, refractive compensation to both lens types was almost complete (negative lens -9.70 D ± 0.41 D, positive lens 7.70 D ± 0.44 D). More than 140 differentially abundant proteins were identified in each lens group relative to the no lens controls at both time points. No proteins were differentially abundant between the negative and positive lens groups at 6 h, and 13 were differentially abundant at 48 h. As there was substantial overlap in the proteins implicated across the six comparisons, a total of 390 differentially abundant proteins were identified. Sixty-five of these 390 proteins had previously been implicated in transcriptome studies of refractive error animal models, and 42 had previously been associated with AMD, choroidal neovascularization, glaucoma, and/or cataract in humans. The overlap of differentially abundant proteins with AMD-associated genes and proteins was statistically significant for all conditions (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p<0.05), with over-representation analysis implicating ontologies related to oxidative stress, cholesterol homeostasis, and melanin biosynthesis. GSEA identified significant enrichment of genes associated with abnormal electroretinogram, photophobia, and nyctalopia phenotypes in the proteins negatively correlated with ocular refraction across the lens groups at 6 h. The implicated proteins were primarily linked to photoreceptor dystrophies and mitochondrial disorders in humans.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Optical defocus in the chicks induces rapid changes in the abundance of many proteins in the retina/RPE that have previously been linked to inherited and age-related ocular pathologies in humans. Similar changes have been identified in a meta-analysis of chick refractive error transcriptome studies, highlighting the chick as a model for the study of optically induced stress with possible relevance to understanding the development of a range of pathological states in humans.\n",

      " Corrugated Bruch's membrane in high myopia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the appearance of Bruch's membrane (BM) in axially elongated eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: The light-microscopical investigation included histological anterior-posterior sections of human eyes. Using a light microscope, we assessed whether BM in the posterior segment was straight or locally corrugated. Corrugation of BM was defined as an elevation of BM with a height >20 μm over a basis of 50 μm without collateral proliferations of retinal pigment epithelium or choroidal swelling.\n",
      "RESULTS: The investigation included 85 eyes (age: 62.0 ± 14.1 years; axial length: 26.7 ± 3.5 mm). In multivariate analysis, the presence of a corrugated BM, detected in eight eyes (9.4%), was strongly associated with the presence of macular BM defects [p = 0.001; odds ratio (OR): 418; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1 215 000], but not with axial length (p = 0.54). Bruch's membrane (BM) corrugation was detected in seven (54%) of 13 eyes with macular BM defects. The single eye with BM corrugation and without macular BM defect showed the corrugated BM located in the parapapillary region at the peripheral end of a large parapapillary gamma zone.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Bruch's membrane (BM) corrugation can be present in the vicinity of macular BM defects in highly myopic eyes, perhaps due to differences in the tension within BM in various regions at the margin of the BM defect. Bruch's membrane (BM) corrugation may also develop at the papillary end of BM in eyes with a large parapapillary gamma zone, potentially due to a disinsertion of BM at the end of the peripapillary choroidal border tissue of Jacoby. The observation of BM corrugation may help elucidating the aetiology of axial myopia.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To describe the characteristics of retinal telangiectasia in eyes with pathologic myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: The study included 10 patients (18 eyes) who were diagnosed with pathologic myopia combined with retinal telangiectasia. The patients visited our retinal clinic every 3 months. Nine eyes underwent vitrectomy for vision-threatening complications after diagnosis. All eyes underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations including multimodal retinal imaging at presentation and at each follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinal telangiectasia in pathologic myopia was characterized by saccular aneurysmal dilatation of the capillary bed without hard exudates in color fundus photographs and hyporeflective saccular structure in infrared reflectance fundus photographs, and it was filled in the early retinal arteriovenous phase with minimal dye leakage in the late phase of fundus fluorescein angiography. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomographic angiography showed that retinal telangiectasia was primarily located in the superficial retina, together with myopic traction maculopathy. In the 9 eyes that underwent vitrectomy, the retinal telangiectasia regressed within 3 months of surgery. Retinal telangiectasia remained stable in the other nine eyes, but these eyes were at risk of spontaneous bleeding.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Retinal telangiectasia is a relatively quiescent and uncommon disorder in patients with pathologic myopia that might be closely related to myopic traction maculopathy.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: The registry system can be used to observe the distribution trend of diseases and analyze the related data to provide useful information in a way that enables the government to take appropriate interventional measures. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes and three-year incidence of newly registered disabled patients who were blind or had low vision in Jing-An District, Shanghai, China from 2010 to 2015.\n",
      "METHODS: Data from the registration system of visual disability in Jing-An District, Shanghai from 2010 to 2015 were collected and analyzed. In this registry, the only person with permanent visual impairment (VI) was identified as being a certified visually impaired person. The main causes of visual disability were obtained, the three-year incidence of visual disability was calculated, and the relationships between blindness or low vision and age, as well as those between blindness or low vision and gender, were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Six-hundred and forty-six newly certified people with VI were registered, including 206 blind patients and 440 low vision patients. The major causes of blindness were myopia macular degeneration (MMD, 23.30%), glaucoma (20.39%), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD, 17.96%). The three leading causes of low vision were MMD (58.86%), AMD (16.36%), and diabetic retinopathy (DR, 7.27%). DR (16.0%) was the first leading cause of blindness and the second leading cause of VI in patients aged 30-59 yrs. from 2010 to 2015. The three-year incidences of blindness in 2010-2012 and 2013-2015(P = 0.43), which remained stable throughout this time period, were 32.74/100000 and 36.51/100000, respectively. However, the three-year incidence of low vision was 64.51/100000 in 2010-2012 and 83.58/100000 in 2013-2015(P = 0.007), which shows that the incidence increased significantly due to the increase of patients with low vision caused by MMD and DR (P = 0.003 and P = 0.01, respectively).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: MMD, glaucoma, and AMD were the main causes of blindness, while DR was becoming a major cause of VI, especially in working-age people of Jing-An District, Shanghai, China.\n",

      " A biolayer interferometry-based enzyme-linked aptamer sorbent assay for real-time and highly sensitive detection of PDGF-BB.\n",
      "Accurate, fast and sensitive detection of disease-specific protein biomarkers, especially in blood, urine, or other bodily fluids, is an important approach to achieve early disease diagnosis. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a widely used biomarker, is involved in a substantial number of serious diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, atherosclerosis, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye disease and is often over-expressed in human malignant tumors. Therefore, the development of sensitive and specific detection methods for PDGF-BB is of great importance for the early diagnosis of disease and assessments of patient recovery. In the current study, a biolayer interferometry-based enzyme-linked aptamer sorbent assay (BLI-ELASA) was successfully established for rapid (20-25min), high-throughput (8 or 16 samples) and real-time monitoring of PDGF-BB in clinical samples. The method exhibited a broad detection range from 0.5 to 1000ng/mL of PDGF-BB (good linear range from 0.5 to 10ng/mL), with a low detection limit of 0.08ng/mL. Moreover, BLI-ELASA was applied to the detection of PDGF-BB in spiked serum and urine samples and showed a high degree of selectivity for PDGF-BB, good reproducibility, and stability. We believe that the methodology in this work can be easily adapted to detect other biomolecules in clinical samples, including viruses, pathogens and toxins, in a rapid, sensitive, high-throughput and real-time manner.\n"

      " PREDICTIVE FACTORS OF SURGICAL OUTCOMES IN VITRECTOMY FOR MYOPIC TRACTION MACULOPATHY.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess predictive factors and surgical outcomes for myopic traction maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective observational case study enrolled 73 patients who underwent vitrectomy for myopic traction maculopathy. The 79 eyes obtained from our study sample were divided into 4 types: retinoschisis, lamellar macular hole (lamellar MH), foveal retinal detachment (FRD), and FRD + lamellar MH, or into 2 types according to the presence of FRD preoperatively. Dependent variables of interest were age, sex, pre- and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 months, and axial length.\n",
      "RESULTS: All the four types showed moderately strong-to-strong positive correlations with pre- and postoperative BCVA (retinochisisi: r = 0.61; lamellar MH: r = 0.62; FRD: r = 0.51; FRD + lamellar MH; r = 0.83). Preoperative BCVA was associated with postoperative BCVA (P < 0.0001), but age, axial length, and the types of preoperative foveal status were not. Eyes with FRD had significantly worse pre- and postoperative BCVA than eyes without FRD (P = 0.036 and P = 0.046, respectively). Postoperative full-thickness macular holes developed in 5.1% of cases and in all types but retinoschisis.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Preoperative visual acuity and the presence of FRD should be considered for surgical indication of myopic traction maculopathy.\n"

      " The Science Behind Myopia\n",
      "None: Myopia (near-sightedness) is the most common refractive vision disorder in children. It is characterized by blurring of objects viewed at a distance, and is commonly the result of abnormal elongation of the eyeball – which causes the refractive image formed by the cornea and the lens to fall in front of the photoreceptors of the retina (Figure 1). The underlying biological cause of myopia is unknown, and there is no widely accepted means of prevention or cure. The optical error of myopia can be corrected only by using spectacle or contact lenses or corneal surgery. If left untreated, moderate myopia is one of the leading causes of visual impairment worldwide. The greater the degree of myopia, the greater the risk of complications such as macular degeneration, retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma (1); the risk is especially great when the negative refractive error is more negative than -6.00 D (diopters), a condition called ‘high myopia’. The prevalence of myopia varies greatly, depending on ethnicity, geographical location, and socioeconomic status, but is rising rapidly in most populations studied (2) (Figure 2). Myopia is a centuries-old problem, and although we have made great progress in scientific investigation of its underlying cause, we have been unsuccessful in preventing it from becoming named by the World Health Organization as an ever-increasing global health concern (3).\n",

      " The Expanded Spectrum of Perifoveal Exudative Vascular Anomalous Complex.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To expand our understanding of the uncommon entity, referred to as perifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex (PEVAC) by describing multimodal imaging findings, including optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A).\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients diagnosed with PEVAC were identified at 4 retina referral centers worldwide and underwent complete ophthalmologic examination including structural OCT, OCT-A, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Demographics and clinical findings were analyzed at baseline and at available follow-ups.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifteen eyes (15 patients, mean age 73 ± 13 years) were included. Six of 15 eyes were diagnosed with coincident age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 2 with myopic macular degeneration. On fundus examination PEVAC presented as a large perifoveal isolated aneurysm, unifocal in 12 of 15 eyes, associated with small retinal hemorrhages and intraretinal exudation. On structural OCT, PEVAC appeared as a round hyperreflective lesion with hyporeflective lumen, typically surrounded by intraretinal cystic spaces. Dye angiography demonstrated a well-defined hyperfluorescent lesion with variable leakage on FA and without leakage on ICGA. OCT-A showed flow signal correlating with the aneurysmal lesion connecting to retinal capillary plexuses. Seven patients were followed for 13.0 ± 10.5 months with no evidence of functional/anatomic changes. Three patients underwent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal injections without improvement. Two eyes were associated with a type 3 neovascularization eccentric to PEVAC.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: PEVAC is an isolated, perifoveal, aneurysmal abnormality, occurring in otherwise healthy patients who may manifest other macular disease including AMD and myopic macular degeneration. PEVAC did not typically respond to anti-VEGF therapy, and may be associated with type 3 neovascularization.\n"

      "METHODS: Seven eyes of 7 patients with macular retinoschisis were studied. Four of these eyes also had a foveal detachment but without a retinal break. All the eyes underwent vitrectomy with the creation of a posterior vitreous detachment and ILM peeling. The excised ILMs were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n",
      "RESULTS: The retinas were reattached in all eyes after the vitrectomy. No retinal breaks including macular holes were identified intraoperatively. Transmission electron microscopy showed glial cells in 4 eyes, retinal pigment epithelium-like cells in 4 eyes, and myofibroblast-like cells in 4 eyes on the excised ILMs. A newly produced basement membrane appeared to merge with the ILM in 5 eyes. Thick collagen was seen in 2 eyes, and fibrous long-spacing collagen in the newly synthesized collagen fibers was seen in 3 eyes. The cellular components of the glial cells appeared to have migrated through the thinner parts of the retina or through a defect of the ILM in 2 eyes.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Cells that migrate onto the surface of the ILM synthesize new collagen, which can create tangential traction. This may explain the success of vitrectomy with ILM peeling in treating MTM in highly myopic eyes.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To report the clinical (anatomic and functional) and genetic findings of Wagner Syndrome (WS) in a Portuguese family.\n",
      "METHODS: Nine members of the family agreed to be examined. All had complete clinical eye examinations. The proband and selected patients underwent color fundus photography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), automatic static white-on-white computerized perimetry, and electrophysiology assessment (flash ERG, multifocal(mf) ERG and dark adaptometry). A pedigree was constructed based on interviews with known affected subjects. Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood were collected from all affected family members examined.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-eight family members are affected. This family has the typical features of Wagner Syndrome, namely an empty vitreous cavity with veils, mild myopia and cataract. Four examined patients underwent vitreoretinal surgery due to abnormal peripheral vitreoretinal adhesions with peripheral retinal traction (n = 3). Retinal detachment was observed in 5 of the examined subjects. Four of them occurred between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Chorioretinal atrophy is also a frequent finding which results in moderate to severe visual field and advanced rod-cone dystrophy from younger ages, also confirmed by absence of scotopic function on dark adaptation. The macular dysfunction on mfERG was profound and of early onset. A heterozygous mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (c.4004-1G > A) was found.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We described a rare autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy with near complete penetrance in a Portuguese family. Abnormal peripheral vitreoretinal adhesions, retinal detachment and chorioretinal atrophy are present in most of the examined individuals at young ages. Early onset of advanced visual field and electrophysiologic abnormalities were observed in this family. We also added relevant information to the literature by reporting our experience in surgical management of Wagner Syndrome patients with, and at risk of, retinal detachment.\n"

      "METHODS: Patients with corrected visual acuity > 20/40 and AL > 24.5 mm were included in the study. Posterior staphyloma and maculopathy were ruled out in all the patients, and 176 eyes were included for analysis. AL was measured with partial coherence interferometry, while keratometry, central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and horizontal white to white (WTW) were measured with slit-scanning topography. Group 1 included 55 eyes with AL < 26.5 mm, group 2 had 57 eyes with AL between 26.5 and 28.5 mm while group 3 had 64 eyes with AL > 28.5 mm.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlation of AL with anterior biometry.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean AL of the study eyes was 27.88 + 2.14 mm. The mean values of ACD (2.99 mm), CCT (0.52 mm), WTW (11.68 mm), and keratometry (43.62 D) were within the normal range. Overall, very weak correlations could be established between AL and CCT (R = 0.17, p = 0.02), AL and keratometry (R = - 0.28, p < 0.001), and AL and WTW (R = 0.22, p = 0.002), while ACD did not relate to AL significantly.

Keratometry had a weak negative relation with AL in groups 1 and 2, while WTW had a weakly positive relation with AL in group 2 only. No variable had any significant relation with AL in group 3.\n",

      " Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy for Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization.\n",
      "Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most vision-impairing complications in patients with pathologic myopia. It is also one of the most frequently encountered non.age-related macular degeneration causes of CNV and affects young patients in the working age group. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) are generally indicated to confirm the diagnosis of active myopic CNV before initiation of treatment. Without treatment, natural history studies have shown that the vision outcome can be very poor. More recently, a number of retrospective, prospective and phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trials have established the safety and efficacy of intravitreal anti.vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for the treatment of myopic CNV. Long-term follow-up studies have found that some of the initial vision gained after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may not be maintained, owing to the presence and progression of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) adjacent to the CNV. Further research on clinical and imaging characteristics may elucidate the prognostic factors that are crucial to optimizing the treatment and prevention of visual impairment associated with myopic CNV.\n",

      " Patient Awareness of Cataract and Age-related Macular Degeneration among the Korean Elderly: A Population-based Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Age-related eye disease is often considered part of natural aging. Lack of awareness of eye conditions can result in missed treatment. We investigated the rates of awareness of cataract and age-related macular degeneration, the most common age-related eye-diseases, and the associated factors among elderly Koreans.\n",
      "METHODS: We identified 7,403 study subjects (≥40 years old) with cataract or age-related macular degeneration based on ophthalmic examination results during the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2010 and 2012. We assessed whether patients were aware of their eye condition based on a previous diagnosis by a physician.\n",
      "RESULTS: The average awareness rate over the 3-year study period was 23.69% in subjects with cataract and 1.45% in subjects with age-related macular degeneration. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with cataract were more likely to recognize their condition if they had myopia (odds ratio, 2.08), hyperopia (odds ratio, 1.33), family history of eye disease (odds ratio, 1.44), or a past eye examination (odds ratio, 4.07-29.10). The presence of diabetes mellitus was also a significant predictor of patient awareness of cataract (odds ratio, 1.88).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Poor patient recognition of eye disease among the Korean elderly highlights the seriousness of this potential public health problem in our aging society. Pre-existing eye-related conditions and diabetes were significant predictors of awareness; therefore, patients in frequent contact with their doctors have a greater chance of detecting eye disease.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and choroidal and retinal thickness values between high myopes without myopic maculopathy and emmetropes.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case control study where 53 myopes with axial length (AL) above 26 mm without myopic maculopathy and 53 age-matched emmetropes with AL between 21.50 and 24.50 were included as controls. Complete ophthalmological examination and biometry were performed. Choroidal and individual retinal layer thickness maps using spectral domain optical coherence tomography were obtained in the macular and peripapillary area with enhanced depth imaging. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness was obtained using the circular 12°diameter scan.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean age was 31.9 ± 9.9 and 32.5 ± 9.3 years in the myopes and controls, respectively (p > 0.05). Mean BCVA was 55.32 ± 2.50 versus 57.04 ± 2.27 ETDRS letters, in the myopes and controls, respectively (p = 0.0004). AL was the principal predictive factor for macular and peripapillary CT in myopes and macular CT in controls. BCVA was not influenced by choroidal thickness (CT). BCVA positively correlated with global pRNFL, following correction for age and AL, in both groups (r = 0.38, p = 0.008 and r = 0.38, p = 0.007 in the myopic and control groups, respectively). Statistical analysis following correction for the potential confounding factors of age, gender, AL, gender, AL, macular CT, and peripapillary CT, showed no significant differences in macular and peripapillary thicknesses between the two groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: AL is the principal predictive factor for macular and peripapillary CT in high myopes without maculopathy, and CT is not an independent predictor of visual acuity. Global pRNFL thickness is the only independent predictive factor of BCVA.\n"

      "This meta-analysis reports on current estimates of the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) based on a review of recent meta-analyses and literature research. Within an age of 45-85 years, global prevalences of any AMD, early AMD, and late AMD were 8.7% [95% credible interval (CrI), 4.3‒17.4], 8.0% (95% CrI, 4.0‒15.5), and 0.4% (95% CrI, 0.2-0.8). Early AMD was more common in individuals of European ancestry (11.2%) than in Asians (6.8%), whereas prevalence of late AMD did not differ significantly. AMD of any type was less common in individuals of African ancestry. The number of individuals with AMD was estimated to be 196 million (95% CrI, 140‒261) in 2020 and 288 million (95% CrI, 205‒399) in 2040. The worldwide number of persons blind (presenting visual acuity < 3/60) or with moderate to severe vision impairment (MSVI; presenting visual acuity < 6/18 to 3/60 inclusive) due to macular disease in 2010 was 2.1 million [95% uncertainty interval (UI), 1.9‒2.7] individuals out of 32.4 million individuals blind and 6.0 million (95% UI, 5.2‒8.1) persons out of 191 million people with MSVI. Age-standardized prevalence of macular diseases as cause of blindness in adults aged 50+ years worldwide decreased from 0.2% (95% UI, 0.2‒0.2) in 1990 to 0.1% (95% UI, 0.1‒0.2) in 2010; as cause for MSVI, it remained mostly unchanged (1990: 0.4%; 95% UI, 0.3‒0.5; 2010: 0.4%; 95% UI, 0.4‒0.6), with no significant sex difference. In 2015, AMD was the fourth most common cause of blindness globally (in approximately 5.8% of blind individuals) and third most common cause for MSVI (3.9%).

      " LncRNA ZNF503-AS1 promotes RPE differentiation by downregulating ZNF503 expression.\n",
      "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important roles in various biological processes. Our previous work has revealed that dedifferentiation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells contributes to the pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Herein, we show roles of lncRNAs in RPE differentiation. We used microarray to identify lncRNA expression profiles in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and hiPSC-derived RPE cells. A total of 217 differentially expressed lncRNAs along with the differentiation were initially identified, among which 13 lncRNAs showed a consistent fold change of over 2. LncRNA ZNF503-AS1, located in the cytoplasm of RPE cells, was found consistently upregulated along with RPE differentiation, and downregulated in the RPE-choroid of AMD patients. In vitro study further suggested that ZNF503-AS1 insufficiency could inhibit RPE differentiation, and promote its proliferation and migration. As ZNF503-AS1 is transcribed from the antisense strand of the ZNF503 gene locus, we further revealed its regulatory role in ZNF503 expression. ZNF503-AS1 was reversely correlated with ZNF503 expression. Our results also suggested that ZNF503 could inhibit RPE differentiation, and promote its proliferation and migration. Thus, ZNF503-AS1 potentially promotes RPE differentiation through downregulation of ZNF503 expression. In addition, nuclear factor-κB was recognized as a potential upstream transcript factor for ZNF503-AS1, which might participate in promoting RPE differentiation by regulating the expression of ZNF503-AS1. Taken together, our study identifies a group of RPE differentiation relevant lncRNAs, and the potential role of ZNF503-AS1 in the pathology of atrophic AMD, which might help with the intervention of AMD patients.\n"

      " Novel evidence for complement system activation in chick myopia and hyperopia models: a meta-analysis of transcriptome datasets.\n",
      "Myopia (short-sightedness) and hyperopia (long-sightedness) occur when the eye grows too long or short, respectively, for its refractive power. There are currently approximately 1.45 billion myopes worldwide and prevalence is rising dramatically. Although high myopia significantly increases the risk of developing a range of sight-threatening disorders, the molecular mechanisms underlying ocular growth regulation and its relationship to these secondary complications remain poorly understood. Thus, this study meta-analyzed transcriptome datasets collected in the commonly used chick model of optically-induced refractive error. Fifteen datasets (collected across five previous studies) were obtained from GEO, preprocessed in Bioconductor, and divided into 4 conditions representing early (≤1 day) and late (>1 day) myopia and hyperopia induction. Differentially expressed genes in each condition were then identified using Rank Product meta-analysis. The results provide novel evidence for transcriptional activation of the complement system during both myopia and hyperopia induction, and confirm existing literature implicating cell signaling, mitochondrial, and structural processes in refractive error. Further comparisons demonstrated that the meta-analysis results also significantly improve concordance with broader omics data types (i.e., human genetic association and animal proteomics studies) relative to previous transcriptome studies, and show extensive similarities with the genes linked to age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, and cataract.\n"

A comprehensive ophthalmic exam was performed with mea surement of both the presenting (PVA) and best-corrected visual acuity. The Quality of Life Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25) were also administered.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 150 non-institutionalized participants were assigned to three age groups: 80-89 years (n=70), 90-99 years (n=50), and 100 years and older (n=30). PVA and best-corrected visual acuity were normal (≥20/30) in 20 (13.3%) and 37 participants (24.7%), respectively. Regarding PVA, mild visual impairment (<20/30 to ≥20/60) was found in in 53 (35.4%), moderate visual impairment (<20/60 to ≥20/200) in 50 (33.3%), severe visual impairment (<20/200 to ≥20/400) in 8 (5.3%), and blindness (<20/400) in 19 (12.7%) participants. Regarding best-corrected visual acuity, mild, moderate, and severe visual impairments were present in 55 (36.7%), 38 (25.3%), and 5 (3.3%) participants, respectively, and blindness was present in 15 (10%). The main causes of visual impairment/blindness were cataract (43.8%), refractive errors (21.5%), age-related macular degeneration (17.7%), and myopic degeneration (3.8%).

We analyzed the following data: patient characteristics, medications used, visual acuity, and complications of cataract surgery.The mean ± standard deviation time from cataract surgery to the last visit was 20.8 ± 10.4 months. Best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly after surgery (P < .001). The visual outcome was worse in patients with Behçet disease than in patients with other etiologies of uveitis. Gender (P = .018) and IOL type (P = .020) were significantly associated with recurrent uveitis after surgery. The incidence of recurrent inflammation was not significantly different between patients who did or did not receive systemic therapy (P = .43). Perioperative systemic therapies (P = .011) and recurrent uveitis within 3 months of surgery (P = .043) were associated with posterior capsular opacification. Perioperative systemic therapies (P = .026) and recurrent uveitis after surgery (P = .006) were also significantly associated with cystoid macular edema.Patients with uveitis could benefit from cataract surgery.

      "RESULTS: Ranibizumab showed superior efficacy versus sham from baseline to Month 2 (adjusted least-squares mean best-corrected visual acuity: +9.5 vs. -0.4 letters; P < 0.001). At Month 12, the mean best-corrected visual acuity change was +11.0 letters (ranibizumab) and +9.3 letters (sham). Across the 5 subgroups, the treatment effect ranged from +5.0 to +14.6 letters. The mean number of ranibizumab injections was 5.8 (ranibizumab arm) with no new ocular or nonocular adverse events.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Ranibizumab 0.5 mg resulted in clinically significant treatment effect versus sham at Month 2. Overall, ranibizumab was effective in treating choroidal neovascularization of various etiologies with no new safety findings.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate changes of the axial length in normal eyes and highly myopic eyes and influence of myopic macular complications in Japanese adults.\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal case series.\n",
      "METHODS: The changes in the axial length of 316 eyes from 316 patients (mean age, 63.8 ± 9.0 years; range, 34-82; 240 females) examined using IOLMaster with a follow-up period of at least 1 year were studied. This study included 85 non-highly myopic eyes (|refractive error| ≤ 5 diopters; 63 females; non-highly myopic group), 165 highly myopic eyes (refractive error ≤ -6 diopters or axial length ≥ 26 mm; 124 females) without macular complications (no complications group), 32 eyes (25 females) with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM group), and 34 eyes (28 females) with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV group).\n",
      "RESULTS: All groups showed a significant increase in the axial length during the follow-up period (mean follow-up, 28.7 ± 16.8 months; range, 12-78) (P < 0.01). Changes in the axial length/year in the no complications group (0.041 ± 0.05 mm) were significantly greater than those in the non-highly myopic group (0.007 ± 0.02 mm) (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, changes in the CNV group (0.081 ± 0.04 mm) were significantly greater than those in the no complications (P < 0.0001) and MTM (0.040 ± 0.05 mm) (P = 0.0059) groups, whereas no significant difference was found between the changes in the MTM and no complications groups (P = 0.91). Multiple regression analyses indicated that CNV eyes (P < 0.0001) and female patients' eyes (P = 0.04) showed greater changes in the axial length/year.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: All groups showed an increase in the axial length, which was greater for highly myopic eyes. In particular, CNV eyes showed greater increases, indicating that larger changes in the axial length may require careful follow-up.\n"

      " Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization: Review, Guidance, and Consensus Statement on Management.\n",
      "TOPIC: The aim of this article is to review and compile available information on the classification, pathophysiology, and clinical features of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV); to describe the latest data on the management of this disease; and to present guidance.\n",
      "CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the United States, myopia affects approximately 34 million people (2010), and similar figures have been reported in Europe. Pathologic myopia (PM), a possible consequence of myopia, is estimated to affect up to 3% of the global population. One of the most serious complications of PM is myopic CNV, which often leads to a sudden onset but progressive decline in central vision and is associated with a poor prognosis unless treated. Furthermore, 35% of patients with myopic CNV develop bilateral disease in the fellow eye within 8 years. Although intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have had a major impact on the management of patients with myopic CNV, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of this condition and how to best administer treatment. Additionally, the long-term safety and efficacy of these treatments are largely unknown.\n",
      "METHODS: We carried out a literature review (September 2015) of all English-language articles in PubMed resulting from searches of the following terms: \"choroidal neovascularization\" AND \"myopia\" OR \"myopic macular degeneration\" OR \"degenerative myopia\" OR \"myopic maculopathy\" OR \"myopic retinopathy\" OR \"pathological myopia\" OR \"pathologic myopia.\"\n",
      "RESULTS: We screened a total of 566 abstracts, and 250 articles were deemed relevant for full publication review. We excluded a further 71, but an additional 44 articles were identified. This resulted in 223 articles being used to develop this review.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Highly myopic patients experiencing a sudden loss of central vision should be referred for further examination. Once a diagnosis of myopic CNV has been confirmed, after fluorescein angiography, treatment initiation should be prompt and anti-VEGF agents considered as first-line therapy, unless contraindicated. Continued monitoring of patients is required to assess any progression or recurrence of the condition.\n"

      " Choroidal thickness in patients with coronary artery disease.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate choroidal thickness (CTh) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to healthy controls.\n",
      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional.\n",
      "METHODS: Setting: Ambulatory clinic of a large city hospital. Patient population: Thirty-four patients had documented CAD, defined as history of >50% obstruction in at least one coronary artery on cardiac catheterization, positive stress test, ST elevation myocardial infarction, or revascularization procedure. Twenty-eight age-matched controls had no self-reported history of CAD or diabetes. Patients with high myopia, dense cataracts, and retinal disease were excluded. Observation procedures: Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography and questionnaire regarding medical and ocular history. Main outcome measures: Subfoveal CTh and CTh 2000 μm superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal to the fovea in the left eye, measured by 2 readers.\n",
      "RESULTS: CTh was significantly lower in patients with CAD compared to controls at the subfoveal location (252 vs. 303 μm, P = 0.002) and at all 4 cardinal macular locations. The mean difference in CTh between the 2 groups ranged from 46 to 75 μm and was greatest in the inferior location. Within the CAD group, CTh was significantly lower temporally (P = 0.007) and nasally (P<0.001) than subfoveally, consistent with the pattern observed in controls. On multivariate analysis, CAD was negatively associated with subfoveal CTh (P = 0.006) after controlling for diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with CAD have a thinner macular choroid than controls, with preservation of the normal spatial CTh pattern. Decreased CTh might predispose patients with CAD to high-risk phenotypes of age-related macular degeneration such as reticular pseudodrusen and could serve as a potential biomarker of disease in CAD.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of a reading rehabilitation program (RRP) in patients with central visual loss (CVL) and assess the impact of the RRP on the quality of life (QoL).\n",
      "METHODS: The RRP included four in-office and 39 in-home training sessions over 6 weeks. Reading speed, duration, and font size were evaluated during each in-office session. The subjective perception of the QoL was assessed before and after the RRP using the short version of a questionnaire (World Health Organization Quality of Life). A control group who received advice about ocular conditions and low-vision aids also was included.\n",
      "RESULTS: Seventeen patients with Stargardt's disease (STGD), 11 with adult-onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy (AFVD), and eight with myopic macular degeneration (MMD) were included. The control group included five patients each with STGD, AFVD, and MMD. The respective mean corrected distance visual acuities (VAs) in patients with STGD, AFVD, MMD, and the control group were 0.57 ± 0.38, 0.51 ± 0.38, 0.49 ± 0.24, and 0.55 ± 0.25 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution; the mean corrected near VAs were 0.89 ± 0.20, 1.08 ± 0.17, 0.99 ± 0.34, and 1.18 ± 0.37 (M notation) using low-vision aids. The reading speed, duration, and font size improved in all groups. The RRP groups obtained (p ≤ 0.01) greater improvements than the control group in each reading performance variable assessed. Patients with STGD obtained greater improvements in the subjective evaluation; the control group did not obtain noteworthy improvement in any domain.\n",

      "BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the clinical findings and anatomical characteristics of patients with a thinned peripheral choroid (leptochoroid) presenting with bilateral macular geographical hyperpigmented fundus and compare with matched controls.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective, observational case series of 44 eyes (24 patients): 22 study eyes (12 study patients) with clinical findings of leptochoroid (geographical hyperpigmented fundus centred in the macula) matched with 22 control eyes (12 control patients). All eyes received enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Two independent observers performed all measurements. Statistical analysis was used to correlate interobserver findings, and compare patient and eye characteristics.\n",
      "RESULTS: Study patients had a female predominance and median age of 70 years. Iris colour and refractive error of these eyes were varied: 8 eyes were myopic (one of which was highly myopic with a refractive error of -9.00) and 14 eyes were emmetropic or hyperopic (up to+3.00). The best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 or better in all study eyes. The geographical macular areas of relative hyperpigmentation correspond to normal choroidal thickness compared with controls (p=0.74). The relative hypopigmented surrounding fundus had significantly thinner choroid compared with controls (p value=0.0001). Choroidal thickness had a strong interobserver correlation (r=0.99, p<0.0001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Described here is a clinical entity referred to as peripheral leptochoroid. It appears as geographical hyperpigmented fundus centred in the macula, with adjacent relative hypopigmented fundus. Compared with matched normal subjects, the hyperpigmented and hypopigmented fundus correspond with equivocal and decreased choroidal thickness, respectively.\n"

      " Associations Between β-Peripapillary Atrophy and Reticular Pseudodrusen in Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Choroidal thinning has been associated with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and β-peripapillary atrophy (β-PPA), which have been linked to normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). This analysis sought to determine whether RPD are independently associated with β-PPA in early AMD patients. Secondary outcomes included the association of RPD and preexisting diagnosis of glaucoma, cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), and IOP.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study examined 78 age- and sex-matched early AMD patients: 43 RPD patients (63 eyes) and 35 non-RPD patients (64 eyes). Exclusion criteria included advanced AMD, high myopia, and vitreoretinal conditions/surgery. RPD and non-RPD groups were identified by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. β-PPA as well as CDR were graded on digital, nonstereoscopic fundus photos. SFCT was measured on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography for 69 patients (35 RPD and 34 non-RPD). IOP and glaucoma diagnosis were extracted from charts.\n",
      "RESULTS: β-PPA had a greater prevalence in RPD than non-RPD (44% vs. 19%, P = 0.002); however, this relationship was not significant when SFCT was added to the model (P = 0.150). A preexisting diagnosis of glaucoma (P = 0.156), CDR (P = 0.176), and IOP (P = 0.98) was not different between groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: RPD in early AMD are associated with presence of β-PPA, but choroidal thickness is a confounder in this relationship. Because β-PPA is a common finding in NTG, focusing on a potential shared pathway between RPD and NTG could improve the understanding of pathophysiology and expand therapies for each condition.\n"

      " Omics Biomarkers in Ophthalmology.\n",
      "\"Omics\" refers to high-throughput analyses of genes, proteins, or metabolites in a biological system, and is increasingly used for ophthalmic research. These system-based approaches can unravel disease-related processes and are valuable for biomarker discovery. Furthermore, potential therapeutic targets can be identified based on omics results, and targeted follow-up experiments can be designed to gain molecular understanding of the disease and to test new therapies. Here, we review the application of omics techniques in eye diseases, focusing on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal detachment (RD), myopia, glaucoma, Fuchs' corneal dystrophy (FCD), cataract, keratoconus, and dry eyes. We observe that genomic analyses were mainly successful in AMD research (almost half of the genomic heritability has been explained), whereas large parts of disease variability or risk remain unsolved in most of the other diseases. Other omics studies like transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics provided additional candidate proteins and pathways for several eye diseases, although sample sizes in these studies were often very small and replication is lacking. In order to translate omics results into clinical biomarkers, larger sample sizes and validation across different cohorts would be essential. In conclusion, omics-based studies are increasing in ophthalmology, and further application to the clinic might develop in the years to come. Integration of genomics with other type of omics data has the potential to improve the accuracy of predictive tests. Moreover, in the future, omics may lead to stratification of patients into subgroups based on molecular profiles, enabling the development of personalized treatments.\n"

      "METHODS: We examined the physical disability certificates issued yearly between 2004 and 2013 in Mie prefecture, Japan. During this period 2468 visually impaired people were registered under the newly defined Act on Welfare of the Physically Disabled Persons' criteria. The age, sex distribution, and causes of visual impairment were determined from the certificates.\n",
      "RESULTS: The major causes of visual impairment during the ten-year period were glaucoma (23.3%), diabetic retinopathy (17.3%), retinitis pigmentosa (12.2%), macular degeneration (9.0%), chorioretinal degeneration or high myopia (7.4%), optic atrophy (5.8%), stroke or brain tumor (5.4%) and cataracts (3.7%). The incidence of glaucoma was significantly higher throughout the period (2004-2013), and that of diabetic retinopathy was lower between 2007 and 2013. The incidence of retinitis pigmentosa did not change significantly during the 10-year period. The incidence of macular degeneration tended to increase between 2004 and 2007, but it decreased significantly between 2007 and 2013.\n",

      "This chapter provides the reader with practical information to be applied to the various remaining causes of macular edema. Some clinical cases of macular edema linked to ocular diseases like postradiotherapy for ocular melanomas remained of poor functional prognosis due to the primary disease. On the contrary, macular edema occurring after retinal detachment or after diverse systemic or local treatment use is often temporary. Macular edema associated with epiretinal membranes or vitreomacular traction is the main cause of poor functional recovery. In other cases, as in tractional myopic vitreoschisis, the delay to observe a significant improvement of the vision after surgery should be long. Finally, macular edema associated with hemangiomas or macroaneurysms should be treated, if symptomatic, using the same current treatment as in diabetic macular edema or exudative macular degeneration. The miscellaneous chapter is always a challenging one, laden with two serious caveats: being too exhaustive or forgetting common circumstances. The author has attempted to provide the reader with useful, practical information that can be applied to the various causes of macular edema.\n"

      " Insight into high myopia and the macula.\n",
      "The incidence of myopia is constantly on the rise. Patients of high myopia and pathological myopia are young and can lose vision due to a number of degenerative changes occurring at the macula. With the emergence of new technologies such as swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography, our understanding of macular pathology in myopia has improved significantly. New conditions such as myopic traction maculopathy have been defined. Early, noninvasive detection of myopic choroidal neovascularization and its differentiation from lacquer cracks is possible with a greater degree of certainty. We discuss the impact of these new exciting and promising technologies and management of macular pathology in myopia. Incorporation of OCT in the microscope has also improved macular surgery. New concepts such as fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane peeling have emerged. A review of literature and our experience in managing all these conditions are discussed.\n",

      "AIM: To describe the choriocapillaris features imaged by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in eyes with myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective, non-invasive, observational case series, 26 eyes with myopic maculopathy and 12 age-matched healthy eyes underwent fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) (highly myopic eyes only), OCT and OCTA, and the choriocapillaris features seen on OCTA and ICGA were compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: In all five (19%) eyes with patchy atrophy of the 26 highly myopic eyes, OCTA showed complete loss of the choriocapillaris and large choroidal vessels in the atrophic area. In nine (35%) eyes with diffuse atrophy in the atrophic area, OCTA showed low-density choriocapillaris in all eyes and medium and large choroidal vessels in seven (78%) eyes. In 23 eyes (88%) with lacquer cracks, OCTA showed partial loss of the choriocapillaris in 22 (96%) eyes in the area of the lacquer cracks. OCTA could not visualise the full length of the lacquer cracks in any eyes compared with ICGA.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: OCTA visualised the choriocapillaris clearly. The choriocapillaris features differed depending to the category of myopic maculopathy. In eyes with lacquer cracks, choriocapillaris rupture might be less advanced than the breaks in Bruch's membrane and retinal pigment epithelium.\n"

      " Evaluation of vitreoretinal interface changes in patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To study the effects of repeated intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drug bevacizumab on the vitreoretinal interface (VRI).\n",
      "METHODS: Patients undergoing intravitreal injection of bevacizumab were enrolled. Eyes with media haze, uveitis, high myopia, history of cataract surgery or laser capsulotomy in last 6 months and complicated pseudophakia were excluded. VRI evaluation was done monthly for a minimum of 6 months. The nature and timing of the change(s) event was recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 100 eyes were evaluated. Thirty-seven eyes developed new vitreoretinal interface change event (VICE). Pseudophakia (OR = 5.23, 95% CI = 1.99-14.07, p = 0.001), pre-injection VRI abnormality (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.13-6.14, p = 0.024) and older age at enrollment (62.6 ± 13.9 vs. 56.3 ± 14 years) were risk factors for development of VICE. Eighty percent of interface events occurred in the first 3 months of therapy. Eight needed surgical intervention for consequences of vitreoretinal separation.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: VICE is not infrequent in eyes receiving anti-VEGF therapy though rarely need surgical intervention. The first 3 months are the critical months to watch out for these events. The treating ophthalmologists must keep the risk factors for development of in mind and monitor and counsel patients accordingly.\n",

      " Possible protective role of the ABCA4 gene c.1268A>G missense variant in Stargardt disease and syndromic retinitis pigmentosa in a Sicilian family: Preliminary data.\n",
      "In the wide horizon of ophthalmologically rare diseases among retinitis pigmentosa forms, Stargardt disease has gradually assumed a significant role due to its heterogeneity. In the present study, we aimed to support one of two opposite hypotheses concerning the causative or protective role of heterozygous c.1268A>G missense variant of the ABCA4 gene in Stargardt disease and in syndromic retinitis pigmentosa. This study was based on a family consisting of three members: proband, age 54, with high myopia, myopic chorioretinitis and retinal dystrophy; wife, age 65, with mild symptoms; daughter, age 29, asymptomatic. After genetic counseling, ABCA4 and RP1 gene analysis was performed. The results highlighted an important genetic picture. The proband was found to carry two variant RP1 SNPs, rs2293869 (c.2953A>T) and rs61739567 (c.6098G>A), and, a wild-type condition for four RP1 polymorphisms, rs444772 (c.2623G>A) and three SNPs in the 'hot-spot' region, exon 4. The proband's wife, instead, showed an opposite condition compared to her husband: a homozygous mutated condition for the first four SNPs analyzed, while the last two were wild-type. Regarding the ABCA4 gene, the proband evidenced a wild-type condition. Furthermore, the wife showed a heterozygous condition of ABCA4 rs3112831 (c.1268A>G). As expected, the daughter presented heterozygosity for all variants of both genes. In conclusion, even though the c.1268A>G missense variant of the ABCA4 gene has often been reported as causative of disease, and in other cases protective of disease, in our family case, the variant appears to reduce or delay the risk of onset of Stargardt disease.\n"

      " [Choroidal Neovascularisation Other than Typical Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration].\n",
      "Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in the context of exsudative age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) can be divided into type 1 (occult) and type 2 (classical) membranes. Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) are \"rare subtypes\" of chorioretinal neovascularisation and are distinguished by their distinct morphology and the sometimes worse response to therapy. Chorioretinal anastomosis, severe exsudates with serosanguinous pigment epithelial detachment and, in PCV, orange-red lesions in the papillomacular bundle can be diagnostic. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of PCV and delivers important information for RAP too. Typical characteristics of PCV include foci of hyperfluoresence, with pulsatile filling in the early phase. This characterises choroidal polypoidal lesions, often in connection with an abnormal choroidal vascular network. In RAP, typical retino-retinal anastomosis can be identified, in particular in areas with pigment epithelial detachment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can complement diagnostic testing. In cases of RAP, early therapy initiation with intravitreal anti-VEGF is crucial for the prognosis of visual acuity. PCV can exhibit spontaneous regression. In active disease, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is efficient in the closure of PCV polyps. In association with CNV, it makes sense to combine PDT and intravitreal anti-VEGF medication. In spite of the initial increase in visual acuity, this state is normally \"only\" stabilised in the long term. In patients with idiopathic secondary CNV membranes (high myopia, post-inflammatory, post-traumatic changes or in hereditary connective tissue diseases), small \"classical\" type 2 membranes are mostly involved. Hence, these are strictly speaking not directly rare subtypes. Nevertheless, these patients are mostly younger, with less protracted illness and limited available regeneration ability of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE): they may therefore differ favourably from the courses with nAMD, with earlier inactivation and with fewer required anti-VEGF injections. CNV with angioid streaks are a special case in this group. Unfortunately, these lesions have a recurrent, protracted and, in the end, mostly frustrating course.\n",

      " [Anti-Aging Approach for Ocular Disorders: from Dry Eye to Retinitis Pigmentosa and Myopia].\n",
      "More than 90% of ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and dry eye, are age-related with the incidence increasing with age. Furthermore, although retinitis pigmentosa and myopia may be associated with hereditary factors, they are also considered age-related diseases since they progress with aging. Thus, instead of targeting individual diseases, a new approach aimed at targeting aging itself is being examined. The most established current anti-aging approach is calorie restriction, considered to induce various gene expressions such as anti-oxidative enzymes contributing to life extension. At first, we confirmed that conditions under increased oxidative stresses, including genetically modified animals, such as Sod-1 knockout mice (KO), Mev1 transgenic mice, and Nrf-2 KO mice, and smoking induces a decrease in tear secretion resulting in dry eye. Recently, we found that dietary supplements containing lactoferrin or lactic acid bacteria suppress oxidative stress in the lacrimal glands, these results need to be considered in association with the current advances in the microbiome research. It is now possible to promote the clinical use of those supplements to increase tear secretion. Calorie restriction (CR) activates longevity gene sirtuins. We also have shown that agents activating sirtuins, such as resveratrol or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) have retinal protective effects. Particularly, NMN is promising since we have confirmed its therapeutic effect against retinitis pigmentosa. Ketone bodies are considered another mechanistic target of CR. We developed eye drops containing ketone bodies, and confirmed a therapeutic effect similar to that of CR. Now we are expanding our investigations to include new therapies for dry eye and neuroprotection for the retina and the optic nerve. Other pathways such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are also considered to be targets for the anti-aging approach. Taken together, the new strategy \"anti-aging\" is one approach in dealing with ocular diseases. The anti-aging approach is promising as the next generation of preventive medicine focusing on aging for the current era with increased health care expenditures.\n"

      " Three-Dimensional Eye Shape, Myopic Maculopathy, and Visual Acuity: The Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center-Brien Holden Vision Institute High Myopia Cohort Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship among eye shape, myopic maculopathy, and visual acuity in highly myopic eyes using 3-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n",
      "DESIGN: Observational case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: The study included 190 eyes of 95 participants with bilateral high myopia from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center-Brien Holden Vision Institute High Myopia Cohort Study, with spherical power ≤-6.00 diopters (D) in both eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: The participants underwent best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus photography, cycloplegic refraction, and ocular biometry. Posterior staphyloma was identified with 3D MRI, and ocular shapes were categorized into spheroidal, ellipsoidal, conical, nasally distorted, temporally distorted, and barrel shapes according to the inferior view from T2-weighted 3D MRI (Achieva 3.0T; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). Myopic maculopathy was graded as C0 to C4 according to the International Photographic Classification and Grading System using fundus photography. The statistical significance of the differences in distribution of myopic maculopathy and BCVA in eyes with different ocular shapes was determined using Pearson's chi-square tests.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distributions of myopic maculopathy and BCVA in relation to different eye shapes.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean spherical equivalent and axial length were -11.74±4.10 D and 28.18±1.73 mm in the right eyes, respectively. The same ocular shapes were observed in both eyes in 69 participants (72.6%). The predominant shape was spheroidal (53.7%), followed by nasally distorted and conical types (both 14.7%). C2 and above myopic maculopathy was observed in all barrel-shaped eyes, in 75% temporally distorted eyes, and in 71.4% nasally distorted and conical eyes. In eyes with posterior staphyloma (n = 22), 18 (81.8%) had C2 and above myopic maculopathy compared with 40 eyes (54.8%) without posterior staphyloma (n = 73). Eyes with temporal and nasal distortion, and eyes with staphyloma were more likely to have BCVA <20/40.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Not all highly myopic eyes are deformed. Spheroid was the predominant ocular shape in this series of young patients with high myopia bilaterally. Barrel-shaped and temporally distorted eyes present significant myopic maculopathy, whereas eyes with posterior staphyloma display more severe chorioretinal atrophy. Eyes of more deformed shapes tend to have more severe myopic maculopathy and worse BCVA.\n"

      " Outer Retinal Tubulation: A Case Series.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The advent of spectral domain optical coherence tomography has led to superb imaging capabilities in addition to enhanced visualization of the retinal layers. Such advancements have led to the identification of a variety of new retinal conditions, including outer retinal tubulations (ORTs). ORTs are ovoid hyporeflective spaces located in the outer retina. The pathogenesis is unclear but seems to involve sublethal injury to the photoreceptors leading to a compensatory reorganization of the photoreceptor layer with the neighboring ellipsoid zone resulting in a hyperreflective border surrounding a central lumen. Most ORTs have been linked to wet age-related macular degeneration; however, these peculiar structures are now seen in a myriad of retinal disorders.\n",
      "CASE REPORTS: Our cases will highlight the wide variety of clinical presentations associated with outer retinal tubulations. The clinical presentations include two cases of wet age-related macular degeneration, a case of presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, a case of central areolar choroidal dystrophy, and a case of pathological myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: By correctly differentiating outer retinal tubulations from other masqueraders, unnecessary referrals and interventions can be minimized. Understanding the various disease entities associated with outer retinal tubulation could give further insight into the mechanism and formation of these structures.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of a patient with primary open-angle glaucoma in whom macular retinoschisis resolved completely after trabeculectomy consistently lowered intraocular pressure (IOP).\n",
      "METHODS: A single case report.\n",
      "RESULTS: We report a case of retinoschisis involving the macula in a patient with primary open-angle glaucoma in the absence of myopic maculopathy, optic nerve anomaly, or x-linked retinoschisis. The patient's glaucoma was associated with progressive visual field loss in the setting of IOP fluctuations related to posture. A trabeculectomy reduced IOP and posture-related IOP fluctuations with subsequent resolution of macular retinoschisis. In the 1-year postoperative period following trabeculectomy, the patient has remained without retinoschisis and visual fields have been stable.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Improved IOP control resulting in resolution of retinoschisis may distinguish retinoschisis associated with glaucoma from other forms of retinoschisis.\n"

      " Clinical Investigation of the Posterior scleral contraction to Treat Macular Traction Maculopathy in Highly Myopic Eyes.\n",
      "Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) can cause vision disabilities in highly myopic eyes. This retrospective case series investigated the clinical outcomes of posterior scleral contraction (PSC) using genipin-cross-linked sclera as the material to treat MTM in highly myopic eyes. In total, 32 eyes from 29 highly myopic patients who underwent PSC for MTM were recruited. The changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and axial length were evaluated, macular reattachment and macular hole (MH) closure was assessed by optical coherence tomography, and complications were evaluated. At the final follow-up, the retina was completely reattached in 25 eyes (78.1%), essentially reattached in 4 eyes (12.5%), and partially reattached in 3 eyes (9.4%). The logMAR BCVA improved significantly from 1.18 ± 0.45 preoperatively to 0.87 ± 0.45 postoperatively (P < 0.001). The 32 eyes were further divided into the MH group (16 eyes) and the non-MH group (16 eyes) for comparison. The MH was closed in 9 eyes (56.3%). The retinal reattachment rate was 75.0% in the MH group and 81.25% in the non-MH group, and the logMAR BCVA improved significantly in both groups. The PSC using genipin-cross-linked sclera as the material can effectively treat MTM in highly myopic eyes, and significant visual improvement can be achieved with minimal complications.\n",

      "METHODS: Prospective, clinic-based case series of 62 eyes of 41 patients with high myopia (≤-6 diopters or axial length ≥26.5 mm). Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) was performed to measure subfoveal CT and ST. Myopic macular degeneration was graded from fundus photographs according to the International Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification. Presence of MMD was defined as META-PM category ≥ 2 and severe MMD was defined as category ≥ 3.\n",
      "RESULTS: The distribution of MMD severity was 15 (24.2%) in category 1, 28 (45.2%) in category 2, 10 (16.1%) in category 3, and 9 (14.5%) in category 4. Correlation of MMD severity was strong for subfoveal CT (r = -0.70, P < 0.001) but weak for subfoveal ST (r = -0.31, P = 0.01). Subfoveal CT, but not ST, was independently associated with presence of MMD (age and gender adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 10 μm decrease in CT 1.41, P = 0.002), and subfoveal CT, but not subfoveal ST, was significantly thinner in eyes with severe MMD (≥ category 3) than in eyes with mild MMD (CT: 31.5 ± 40.5 μm versus 82.0 ± 57.1 μm, P < 0.001; ST: 261.6 ± 78.5 μm versus 297.0 ± 73.8 μm, P = 0.09).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated significant thinning of the choroid with increasing MMD severity. In contrast, ST was weakly correlated with MMD. These data suggest progressive loss of choroid may be important in the pathogenesis of MMD.\n"

      "METHODS: Clinical characterizations, whole-exome sequencing, and genome-wide linkage analysis were carried out on the family. Zebrafish models were used to investigate the pathogenesis of GUCA1A mutations.\n",
      "RESULTS: A novel mutation, GUCA1A p.R120L, was identified in the family and predicted to alter the tertiary structure of guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 1, a photoreceptor-expressed protein encoded by the GUCA1A gene. The mutation was shown in zebrafish to cause significant disruptions in photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium, together with atrophies of retinal vessels and choriocapillaris. Those phenotypes could not be fully rescued by exogenous wild-type GUCA1A, suggesting a likely gain-of-function mechanism for p.R120L. GUCA1A p.D100E, another mutation previously implicated in cone dystrophy, also impaired the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors in zebrafish, but probably via a dominant negative effect.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We conclude that GUCA1A mutations could cause significant variability in maculopathies, including central areolar choroidal dystrophy, which represents a severe pattern of maculopathy. The diverse pathogenic modes of GUCA1A mutations may explain the phenotypic diversities.Genet Med advance online publication 26 January 2017.\n"

      " Rehabilitation Approaches in Macular Degeneration Patients.\n",
      "Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a visual disease that affects elderly population. It entails a progressive loss of central vision whose consequences are dramatic for the patient's quality of life. Current rehabilitation programs are restricted to technical aids based on visual devices. They only temporarily improve specific visual functions such as reading skills. Considering the rapid increase of the aging population worldwide, it is crucial to intensify clinical research on AMD in order to develop simple and efficient methods that improve the patient's visual performances in many different contexts. One very promising approach to face this challenge is based on perceptual learning (PL). Through intensive practice, PL can induce neural plasticity in sensory cortices and result in long-lasting enhancements for various perceptual tasks in both normal and visually impaired populations. A growing number of studies showed how appropriate PL protocols improve visual functions in visual disorders, namely amblyopia, presbyopia or myopia. In order to successfully apply these approaches to more severe conditions such as AMD, numerous challenges have to be overcome. Indeed, the overall elderly age of patients and the reduced cortical surface that is devoted to peripheral vision potentially limit neural plasticity in this population. In addition, ocular fixation becomes much less stable because patients have to rely on peripheral fixation spots outside the scotoma whose size keeps on evolving. The aim of this review article is to discuss the recent literature on this topic and to offer a unified approach for developing new rehabilitation programs of AMD using PL. We argue that with an appropriate experimental and training protocol that is adapted to each patient needs, PL can offer fascinating opportunities for the development of simple, non-expensive rehabilitation approaches a large spectrum of visual functions in AMD patients.\n"

      " Corneo-scleral contact lens in a piggyback system for keratoconus: A case report.\n",
      "PURPOSE: We describe a case of fitting a corneo-scleral contact lens with a multi-aspheric geometry design (MAGD CScL) on top of a daily silicone hydrogel lens (piggyback system) for keratoconus management.\n",
      "METHODS: A 48-year-old man using soft toric contact lenses required an improvement in the unsatisfactory quality of his vision. He presented with bilateral asymmetric keratoconus with high myopia in the right eye (RE) and severe myopia in the left eye (LE). In addition, he had low vision in his LE because of a maculopathy. He was fitted with MAGD CScL to correct his irregular astigmatism. A diagnostic trial set was used in the fitting process and the patient was assessed according to a standardised fitting methodology. Visual acuity, corneal topography and contrast sensitivity were evaluated. The follow-up period was 1year.\n",
      "RESULTS: The best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was 0.5 logMAR for the RE with -10 D/-5 D×60° and 2 logMAR for the LE with -20 D/-3 D×105°. After fitting MAGD CScL, visual acuity improved significantly to 0.1 logMAR for the RE and 1.3 logMAR for the LE, as well as contrast sensitivity. The fitting parameters of the base curve, diameter, and power were 7.05mm, 12.60mm, -18.50 D and 7.15mm, 12.60mm, -19 D for the RE and LE, respectively. Optimal fitting characteristics were found in terms of lens position and lens movement. To increase the time of MAGD CScL wear, they piggybacked on daily silicone hydrogel lenses of low power (-0.5 D). The patient reported being comfortable with this piggyback system for approximately 15h a day. After 1year of using the piggyback system, visual quality and wearing time were maintained. In addition, no adverse ocular effects were found during this period.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This case report shows that in this patient a MAGD CScL could be fitted successfully on a daily silicone hydrogel lens in a piggyback system for keratoconus management, providing good visual quality along with prolonged use times and without adverse effects on the cornea.\n",

      " SHORT-TERM SAFETY OF 2 MG INTRAVITREAL ZIV-AFLIBERCEPT.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety of single intravitreal 2 mg ziv-aflibercept (0.08 mL) injections for the treatment of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM).\n",
      "METHODS: Eyes with choroidal neovascular membranes because of several conditions each received single intravitreal injections of 2 mg ziv-aflibercept (0.08 mL). Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and detailed systemic evaluations were performed at baseline and Days 1, 7, and 30 after injections. Standard electroretinography was performed at baseline and Day 30. Primary outcome measures consisted of safety assessments (signs of clinical toxicity and electroretinographic abnormalities). Secondary outcome measures included changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CST) of the macula.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twenty-one eyes of 20 patients (12 males) received injections. Etiologies responsible for the choroidal neovascular membranes included age-related macular degeneration (14), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) (3), myopia (2), and idiopathic juxtafoveal telangiectasia (2). None of the patients complained of worsening vision or pain after the intravitreal injections and no intraocular inflammation was seen. No significant changes in the electroretinographic b/a ratio from baseline to 1 month were measured (scotopic: P = 0.89; photopic: P = 0.13) and mean intraocular pressures were unchanged (14.2 ± 3.6 vs. 13.7 ± 3.0 mmHg; P = 0.62). Mean best-corrected visual acuity did not change significantly from baseline to 1 month (0.66 ± 0.37 logMAR [Snellen equivalent: 20/100] vs. 0.61 ± 0.35 logMAR [Snellen equivalent: 20/80]; P = 0.72) but significant improvements in central subfield thickness were seen (343 ± 177 vs. 210 ± 133 μm; P = 0.01).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Single intravitreal injections of 2 mg ziv-aflibercept (0.08 mL) appear to be safe through 1 month.\n"

      " Prevalence and associated factors of myopia among high school students in Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia, 2016.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Myopia is an important cause of correctable visual impairment and preventable blindness worldwide. Prevalence rates are approximately 20%-35% among the older teenage population globally. It has a medical burden of pathologic complications such as maculopathy and glaucomatous optic neuropathy. High school students experience high-performance and study pressures in the preparation for the final national examination. As a result they are exposed to excessive near work and indoor activities. They are also ignored for regular screening.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of myopia among high school students in Gondar town, Ethiopia.\n",
      "METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 498 high school students with systematic random sampling method from April 18 to April 29, 2016, in three full-cycle high schools (9th-12th grades). A standardized structured questionnaire, Snellen acuity chart, pinhole, retinoscope, trial case lenses, pen torch, and direct ophthalmoscope were used to collect data.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 495 study participants were included, and they had a mean age of 17.48±1.59 years. The prevalence of myopia was 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.2, 17.9). Family history of myopia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=8.08 [95% CI: 4.30, 15.16]), school being private (AOR=2.88 [95% CI: 1.02, 8.11]), longer time spent for near work (AOR=2.89 [95% CI: 1.12, 7.43]), longer time spent partaking in indoor activities (AOR=4.32 [95% CI: 1.69, 10.99]), shorter near working distance (AOR=3.06 [95% CI: 1.33, 7.06]), lack of outdoor sport activities (AOR=2.27 [95% CI: 1.05, 4.90]), use of visual display units (AOR=2.81 [95% CI: 1.30, 6.10]), and abnormal ocular findings (AOR=6.69 [CI: 3.43, 13.03]) were found to be independently associated with myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The prevalence of myopia was 11.9%. Family history for myopia, school being private, longer time spent partaking in indoor activities, shorter working distance, lack of outdoor sport activities, use of visual display units, and presence of abnormal ocular findings were positively associated with myopia.\n"

      " CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF INTRAVITREAL BEVACIZUMAB VERSUS PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY WITH OR WITHOUT BEVACIZUMAB FOR MYOPIC CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION: A 7-Year Follow-up Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To compare the long-term visual outcomes of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) with those of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for myopic choroidal neovascularization over a 7-year period.\n",
      "METHODS: Eyes treated with IVB (17 eyes) or PDT (20 eyes) that were followed up for at least 7 years were included in this retrospective study. Myopic maculopathy was classified according to the international photographic classification before treatment. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and the chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) size were measured before and after treatment over a 7-year period.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean change in BCVA at 7 years was greater in the IVB group than in the PDT group (P = 0.044). While BCVA improved from baseline throughout the 7-year period in the IVB group (P = 0.029), there was no improvement in the PDT group (P = 0.266). In subgroup analysis for 18 eyes with preoperative tessellated fundi (Category 1), there was no difference in BCVA improvement (P = 0.166) and CRA size between the 2 groups at 7 years. However, for 17 eyes with preoperative diffuse CRA (Category 2), BCVA remained unchanged in the IVB group and decreased in the PDT group (P = 0.030) at 7 years.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: IVB resulted in superior long-term functional and anatomical outcomes compared with PDT. In particular, PDT resulted in a greater BCVA decrease and CRA increase compared with IVB in eyes with preoperative diffuse CRA. However, the clinical outcomes were not different in eyes with preoperative tessellated fundi.\n"

      " The risks and benefits of sun exposure 2016.\n",
      "Public health authorities in the United States are recommending that men, women and children reduce their exposure to sunlight, based on concerns that this exposure will promote skin cancer. On the other hand, data show that increasing numbers of Americans suffer from vitamin D deficiencies and serious health problems caused by insufficient sun exposure. The body of science concerning the benefits of moderate sun exposure is growing rapidly, and is causing a different perception of sun/UV as it relates to human health. Melanoma and its relationship to sun exposure and sunburn is not adequately addressed in most of the scientific literature. Reports of favorable health outcomes related to adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration or vitamin D supplementation have been inappropriately merged, so that benefits of sun exposure other than production of vitamin D are not adequately described. This review of recent studies and their analyses consider the risks and benefits of sun exposure which indicate that insufficient sun exposure is an emerging public health problem. This review considers the studies that have shown a wide range health benefits from sun/UV exposure. These benefits include among others various types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease/dementia, myopia and macular degeneration, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The message of sun avoidance must be changed to acceptance of non-burning sun exposure sufficient to achieve serum 25(OH)D concentration of 30 ng/mL or higher in the sunny season and the general benefits of UV exposure beyond those of vitamin D.\n"

      " Association Between Myopia, Ultraviolet B Radiation Exposure, Serum Vitamin D Concentrations, and Genetic Polymorphisms in Vitamin D Metabolic Pathways in a Multicountry European Study.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: Myopia is becoming increasingly common globally and is associated with potentially sight-threatening complications. Spending time outdoors is protective, but the mechanism underlying this association is poorly understood.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of myopia with ultraviolet B radiation (UVB; directly associated with time outdoors and sunlight exposure), serum vitamin D concentrations, and vitamin D pathway genetic variants, adjusting for years in education.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, population-based random sample of participants 65 years and older was chosen from 6 study centers from the European Eye Study between November 6, 2000, to November 15, 2002. Of 4187 participants, 4166 attended an eye examination including refraction, gave a blood sample, and were interviewed by trained fieldworkers using a structured questionnaire. Myopia was defined as a mean spherical equivalent of -0.75 diopters or less. Exclusion criteria included aphakia, pseudophakia, late age-related macular degeneration, and vision impairment due to cataract, resulting in 371 participants with myopia and 2797 without.\n",
      "EXPOSURES: Exposure to UVB estimated by combining meteorological and questionnaire data at different ages, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolic pathway genes, serum vitamin D3 concentrations, and years of education.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Odds ratios (ORs) of UVB, serum vitamin D3 concentrations, vitamin D single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and myopia estimated from logistic regression.\n",
      "RESULT: Of the included 3168 participants, the mean (SD) age was 72.4 (5) years, and 1456 (46.0%) were male. An SD increase in UVB exposure at age 14 to 19 years (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.92) and 20 to 39 years (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93) was associated with a reduced adjusted OR of myopia; those in the highest tertile of years of education had twice the OR of myopia (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.41-3.06). No independent associations between myopia and serum vitamin D3 concentrations nor variants in genes associated with vitamin D metabolism were found. An unexpected finding was that the highest quintile of plasma lutein concentrations was associated with a reduced OR of myopia (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.72).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increased UVB exposure was associated with reduced myopia, particularly in adolescence and young adulthood. The association was not altered by adjusting for education. We found no convincing evidence for a direct role of vitamin D in myopia risk. The relationship between high plasma lutein concentrations and a lower risk of myopia requires replication.\n"

      " Pathologic Myopia.\n",
      "Pathologic myopia (PM) is the only myopia that causes the loss of best-corrected visual acuity. The main reason for best-corrected visual acuity loss is complications specific to PM, such as myopic maculopathy, myopic traction maculopathy, and myopic optic neuropathy (or glaucoma). The meta-analyses of the PM study group (META-PM study) made a classification system for myopic maculopathy. On the basis of this study, PM has been defined as eyes having atrophic changes equal to or more severe than diffuse atrophy. Posterior staphyloma and eye deformity are important causes of developing vision-threatening complications. Posterior staphyloma is unique to PM, except for inferior staphyloma due to tilted disc syndrome. It is defined as an outpouching of the wall of the eye that has a radius of curvature that is less than the surrounding curvature of the wall of the eye. The mechanical load onto the important region for central vision (optic nerve and macula) is not comparable between eyes with and without posterior staphyloma. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool to analyze the entire shape of the eye. When ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography is available, it is expected to be a new tool that will surpass 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. In the future, preventive therapies targeting staphyloma and eye deformity are expected before vision-threatening complications develop and it is too late for patients.\n",

      " Prevalence of outer retinal tubulation in eyes with choroidal neovascularization.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Outer retinal tubulations (ORTs) are branching tubular structures located in the outer nuclear layer of the retina. The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of ORTs observed in eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) undergoing treatment with anti-angiogenic intravitreous injection (IVI) with anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) at the Ophthalmology Department of a tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a descriptive study based on medical charts and Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (Sd-OCT) scans of 142 patients (158 eyes) treated between 2012 and 2014 with IVI of anti-VEGF for CNV. The patients' data was analysed according to age, gender, pathology, presence of ORTs, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Patients with and without ORTs were compared according to the last BCVA obtained using Chi square corrected by the Yates factor.\n",
      "RESULTS: ORTs were found in a total of 40 out of 158 eyes (25.31 %) with CNV; in 33 out of 119 eyes (27.7 %) with neovascular age-related macular disease (AMD); in 5 out of 8 eyes (62.5 %) with neovascular angioid streaks; and in 2 out of 12 eyes (16.67 %) with myopic neovascular membranes. Most patients with ORTs had BCVA worse than 20/200, significantly worse BCVA than patients without ORTs.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies have considered that the presence of ORTs is indicative of a photoreceptor degeneration process and may represent a final stage of multiple retinal degenerative pathologies. The prevalence of ORTs in eyes with CNV has not been well described, especially when considering the Brazilian population treated in a public health care system. In our study, ORTs were observed in only three different pathologies: neovascular AMD, neovascular angioid streaks and myopic neovascular membranes. The correct recognition of ORTs is fundamental for its differentiation from intraretinal cysts, for the latter is related to the activity of neovascular diseases, and usually guides anti-angiogenic therapy. We conclude that ORTs have a high prevalence in the population studied, and their correct identification presents relevant therapeutic implications.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To determine the outcomes of vitrectomy with scleral imbrication in highly myopic eyes with either myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) or macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD).\n",
      "METHODS: The medical records of 17 patients who had undergone vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and scleral imbrication for MTM or MHRD were reviewed. The best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs), the axial length, the macular hole (MH) closure rate, and the shape of the posterior segment determined by optical coherence tomography were evaluated. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) was also performed on five eyes.\n",
      "RESULTS: The postoperative BCVA improved significantly from 0.76 ± 0.39 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units to 0.53 ± 0.35 logMAR units (P = 0.0004). The axial length decreased from 29.42 ± 1.81 mm to 27.97 ± 1.71 mm at 1 month. The MTM was resolved or decreased in all eyes. The MH was closed in 44 % of the MHRD eyes, and the retina was reattached in all of the MHRD eyes. The horizontal distance between the optic disc and the bottom of the posterior staphyloma was significantly decreased at 1 month (P = 0.012) but not at later times. The 3D-MRI images showed a reduction in the distance between the bottom of the posterior staphyloma and the center of the eye (P = 0.029) and a flattening of the posterior staphyloma (P = 0.010).\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The aim of this user observational study was to illustrate the effectiveness of intravitreal operative medication administration (IVOM) in the clinical routine.\n",
      "DESIGN: A monocentric, single arm, prospective study.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: Included in this study were all patients in whom a macular edema was diagnosed during an ophthalmological examination at the Barmherzigen Brüdern Hospital in Linz from November 2012 to August 2014 and who were treated as outpatients or day clinic patients with IVOM using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The parameters measured during the clinical routine were as follows: best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart, central optical coherence tomography (OCT) thickness, diagnosis and possible prior treatment with IVOM. Following diagnosis, the IVOM was administered in 6‑week intervals and a final control with measurement of the named parameters (approximately 19 weeks after diagnosis). If edema was present a further 3‑stage series (19 weeks) was initiated.

In 47 (3.2%) eyes macular edema with myopic CNV (mCNV) was detected and 67 eyes (4.5%) were not further classified under \"others\". In all groups a gain in letters could be achieved in the EDTRS chart even after the first IVOM series: AMD + 3.4, DME + 1.3, AVT + 6.1, CVT + 10.1 and mCNV + 7.0. Patients who were treated with IVOM for the first time showed on average a better response than those previously treated with IVOM.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: As in many other studies our data also underline the necessity for intravitreal injections for treatment of macular edema. Even if a 6‑week interval does not nowadays correspond to the current guidelines, we could achieve a stabilization of vision and do not shy away from comparison with large studies, such as the Marina study. In order to provide the increasing numbers of patients the best treatment in the future, an attempt at targeted implementation of resources must be made and if necessary symptoms which can be conservatively treated should be delegated to the private sector.\n"

      " The Choroid and Optical Coherence Tomography.\n",
      "The choroid is the most vascular tissue in the eye and it plays an important role in the pathophysiology of various common chorioretinal diseases such as central serous retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and degenerative myopia. Quantitative assessment of the choroid has been quite challenging with traditional imaging modalities such as indocyanine green angiography and ultrasonography due to limited resolution and repeatability. With the advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology, detailed visualization of the choroid in vivo is now possible. Measurements of choroidal thickness have also enabled new directions in research to study normal and pathological processes within the choroid. The aim of the present study is to review the current literature on choroidal imaging using OCT.\n",

      " Lamellar macular hole in high myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma: morphological and functional characteristics.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To study morphological and functional characteristics of myopic lamellar macular hole (LMH) with posterior staphyloma.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective observational longitudinal study. Forty myopic eyes affected by LMH and posterior staphyloma have been examined. Pathological myopia was defined as axial length equal or superior to 26.5 mm. LMH was defined on the basis of the following characteristics: irregular foveal contour, inner retinal defect with or without intraretinal splitting and absence of full thickness retinal defect. Demographic and functional parameters were: age, sex, status of lens and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Tomographic parameters were: type of LMH, macular retinoschisis (MRS), posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), type of epiretinal membrane (ERM), integrity of ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane (ELM), residual foveal thickness (RFT) and maximal diameter of intraretinal splitting (MDIRS).\n",
      "RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed a significant prevalence of posterior vitreous adherence in the atypical ERM subgroup (P = 0.001). EZ (P = 0.006) and ELM (P = 0.007) damages were significantly associated with the atypical ERM subgroup. RFT was statistically lower in the atypical ERM subgroup compared to the conventional ERM subgroup (P = 0.015). During the follow-up, the statistical analysis showed a significant reduction of RFT in the atypical ERM subgroup (P = 0.041).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Myopic lamellar macular hole (LMH) associated with atypical ERM is a more severe clinical entity than myopic LMH associated with conventional ERM.\n"

      "PURPOSE: We aimed to study the morphological characteristics of myopic posterior staphyloma in Caucasians and to evaluate the correlation between posterior staphyloma, myopic macular lesions and visual acuity.\n",
      "METHODS: Ninety eyes of 67 consecutive patients affected by high myopia associated with posterior staphyloma were recruited between January 2012 and December 2013. Posterior staphyloma was classified according to Curtin's criteria. Every patient underwent fundoscopic examination and best corrected visual acuity measurement (BCVA). A and B-scan ultrasound (US), high-resolution, three-dimensional magnetic resonance image (MRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), red free (RF) and color fundus photography studies were performed.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age was 64.4 ± 9.48 years (range: 41-82). The mean BCVA was 0.7 ± 0.5 logMAR (range: 0-2). The mean axial length was 29.92 ± 2.39 millimeters (range: 24.25-36.53). The authors found four types of posterior staphyloma according to Curtin's classification: I, II, IV and IX. Significant prevalence of posterior staphyloma in female sex was observed (p = 0.0235). Significant correlation between the depth and the diameters of posterior staphyloma was demonstrated (p < 0.0001). Significant association between posterior staphyloma type and tomographic foveal patterns (p = 0.0230) was highlighted. Posterior staphyloma type I was more frequently associated with peripapillary atrophy and less with macular atrophy compared to type II and IX (p = 0.0169). The prevalence of macular atrophy was more than double in posterior staphyloma type II (33.3 %) in comparison to posterior staphyloma type I (12.5 %).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the type I and II are the most common types of posterior staphyloma, as already highlighted in the literature. A significant association between the type of posterior staphyloma and the MRI ocular shape pattern, the OCT patterns of macular profile and the location of chorioretinal atrophy was highlighted. The correlation between the depth and the width of posterior staphyloma has demonstrated that the deeper the staphyloma, the wider it was. The deepest area of the posterior staphyloma was characterized by a greater thinning of the sclera and by a higher prevalence of chorioretinal atrophy compared to the other parts of the eye. More studies are necessary to support our findings and to add more information on the natural evolution of posterior staphyloma and on its associated complications.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To describe two cases of dome-shaped macula (DSM) and serous macular detachment, the diagnosis of which was enhanced with a radial optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning protocol.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective case series of DSM associated with serous macular detachment. Multimodal retinal imaging was performed including spectral domain OCT with a radial scan protocol and en face OCT angiography. Anatomical outcomes before and after therapy are presented.\n",
      "RESULTS: Two cases of DSM associated with serous macular detachment are described. The dome-shaped macular bulge was more clearly elicited as the cause of serous macular detachment with the employment of a radial OCT scanning protocol. Subretinal fluid resolved in both cases using either intravitreal aflibercept injection or half-fluence photodynamic therapy. En face OCT angiography of the choroid demonstrated reduction in the caliber of choroidal vessels after treatment.\n",

      " WHAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF PATHOLOGIC MYOPIA?\n",
      "PURPOSE: Despite being a major cause of visual impairment worldwide, pathologic myopia has not been clearly and consistently defined. This lack of a standardized definition has made comparisons among epidemiological studies difficult. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to summarize the definitions of pathologic myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: A literature search was conducted of Pubmed to identify reports presenting definitions of pathologic myopia.\n",
      "RESULTS: Although cut-off values for refractive error and increased axial length have been used in some studies, a definition based solely on such values is considered to just show a 'high degree of myopia'. Similarly, the presence of myopic fundus lesions in addition to a high degree of myopia has been used to define pathologic myopia; however, such lesions often develop with age and they are not characteristic of pathologic myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: So, what is pathologic myopia? This review covers the various proposed definitions for pathologic myopia, and describes its major features such as posterior staphyloma, variation in axial length, and the presence of myopic maculopathy. Some unanswered questions that serve as signposts to areas of interest for future research have also been discussed.\n"

      " Detection of aqueous VEGF concentrations before and after intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibody using low-volume sampling paper-based ELISA.\n",
      "Intraocular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels play an important role in the pathogenesis of blindness-related diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, we aimed to develop a paper-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (P-ELISA) to analyze the suppression of aqueous VEGF concentrations following intravitreal injection (IVI) of anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab or ranibizumab). A total of 25 eyes with wet AMD, one with myopic neovascularization, and one with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy were enrolled in this study. The limit of detection using P-ELISA was 0.03 pg/mL. Forty-six consecutive samples of aqueous humor were acquired. From all samples, 66.67% (10/15) achieved complete VEGF suppression (below the detection limit) within 5 weeks of receiving IVI of anti-VEGF antibody. Only 13.33% of samples (2/15) achieved complete VEGF suppression 5 weeks after receiving treatment. In some patients, elevated VEGF was still detected 5 weeks after receipt of anti-VEGF antibody, and all samples (10/10) were found to have elevated VEGF levels 49 days after treatment. Thus, we suggest that monthly IVI of anti-VEGF antibody may be required to ensure durable VEGF inhibition. Ultrasensitive P-ELISA can detect elevated VEGF at an earlier time point and may facilitate decision-making regarding appropriate treatment strategies.\n"

      " Evaluation of 10 AMD Associated Polymorphisms as a Cause of Choroidal Neovascularization in Highly Myopic Eyes.\n",
      "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) commonly occurs in age related macular degeneration and pathological myopia patients. In this study we conducted a case-control prospective study including 431 participants. The aim of this study was to determine the potential association between 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in 4 different genetic regions (CFI, COL8A1, LIPC, and APOE), and choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration and the development of choroidal neovascularization in highly myopic eyes of a Caucasian population. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex and hypertension was performed for each allele, genotype and haplotype frequency analysis. We found that in the univariate analysis that both single-nucleotide polymorphisms in COL8A1 gene (rs13095226 and rs669676) together with age, sex and hypertension were significantly associated with myopic CNV development in Spanish patients (p<0.05). After correcting for multiple testing none of the polymorphisms studied remained significantly associated with myopic CNV (p>0.05); however, analysis of the axial length between genotypes of rs13095226 revealed an important influence of COL8A1 in the development of CNV in high myopia. Furthermore we conducted a meta-analysis of COL8A1, CFI and LIPC genes SNPs (rs669676, rs10033900 and rs10468017) and found that only rs669676 of these SNPs were associated with high myopia neovascularization.\n"

      "METHODS: This is a prospective comparative observational study (NCT02205632) including high myopic patients with or without LC. High myopia was defined as a refractive error greater than 6 diopters of myopia or axial length greater than 26mm. All patients underwent best-corrected visual acuity in logMAR, MPOD measurement, multicolor imaging, SD-OCT, autofluorescence and axial length measurement. MPOD was calculated using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Group 1 was defined as eyes without LC and group 2 as eyes with LC.\n",
      "RESULTS: Forty-five eyes of 32 patients with a mean age of 51.3 years were included in group 1, and 15 eyes of 13 patients aged 54.1 in group 2 (P=0.56). Mean spherical equivalent was -10.11 diopters in group 1 and -15.11 in group 2 (P=0.0004). Mean visual acuity was +0.08 logMAR (0.8 in decimal notation) in group 1 and +0.11 logMAR (0.8 in decimal notation) in group 2 (P=0.061). Axial length was 27.8mm in group 1 and 29.2 in group 2 (P=0.0052). Central macular thickness was lower in group 1 (295μm) than in group 2 (305μm) (P<0.0001), and macular choroidal thickness did not differ between the two groups (P=0.094). Mean MPOD in group 2 was 0.52 and 0.63 in group 1 (P=0.042). Differences in axial length were not related to MPOD measurements (P=0.74).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: A lower rate of MPOD was observed in cases of LC in high myopia. Further studies are needed to investigate if dietary carotenoids could have a protective effect in reducing the risk of LC.\n"

      "METHODS: This retrospective interventional case series included eight patients with acquired, unilateral macular retinoschisis with or without foveal detachment. Patients with an optic disk pit, vitreomacular traction, or high myopia were excluded. Six of the eight patients underwent vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling and fluid-air exchange. The surgical outcome was evaluated in terms of the improvement in the macular anatomy and the best-corrected visual acuity.\n",
      "RESULTS: During vitrectomy, all the six eyes were confirmed to have preexisting posterior vitreous detachment. Macular retinoschisis was resolved or reduced in all the six eyes after vitrectomy. The mean central foveal thickness showed significant improvement at the time of the patient's final visit after vitrectomy. The mean best-corrected visual acuity was 20/52 before surgery and 20/31 at the final visit.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Vitrectomy might be effective for the treatment of macular retinoschisis without an optic disk pit. Although clinically similar to optic pit maculopathy except for the absence of pit, our intraoperative observations of the posterior hyaloid membrane suggest that maculopathy without optic disk pit has a distinct pathogenesis.\n",

      "METHODS: All consecutive patients treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF injection over a 1-month period were included in a prospective multicenter survey. The reason for intravitreal anti-VEGF injection and the involvement of the fellow eye in the pathology requiring a treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF were recorded. A time interval between bilateral injections longer than 1 month, within a 1-month period, and same-day bilateral injections were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 1335 patients were included, corresponding to 1024 (76.7 %) patients treated for nAMD, 167 (12.5 %) for DME, and 144 (10.8 %) for other reasons. Four hundred and fifty-nine (34.4 %) patients were treated bilaterally with a time interval between injections longer than 1 month, 170 (12.7 %) were treated bilaterally within a 1-month interval, and 87 (6.6 %) had same-day bilateral injections. Bilateral injections were more frequent in diabetic patients than in nAMD patients (respectively 48 % vs. 36 %, p = 0.0033).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DME are more likely to be treated bilaterally with anti-VEGF injections. As the rate of second eye involvement requiring treatment increases progressively over time, a same-day bilateral injection strategy will become more common as it decreases the administrative burden on the healthcare system and treatment burden experienced by patients.\n"

      " Long-Term Follow-Up of the Fellow Eye in Patients Undergoing Surgery on One Eye for Treating Myopic Traction Maculopathy.\n",
      "Objective. To observe the fellow eye in patients undergoing surgery on one eye for treating myopic traction maculopathy. Methods. 99 fellow eyes of consecutive patients who underwent unilateral surgery to treat MTM were retrospectively evaluated. All patients underwent thorough ophthalmologic examinations, including age, gender, duration of follow-up, refraction, axial length, intraocular pressure, lens status, presence/absence of a staphyloma, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Fundus photographs and SD-OCT images were obtained. When feasible, MP-1 microperimetry was performed to evaluate macular sensitivity and fixation stability. Results. At an average follow-up time of 24.7 months, 7% fellow eyes exhibited partial or complete MTM resolution, 68% stabilized, and 25% exhibited progression of MTM. Of the 38 eyes with \"normal\" macular structure on initial examination, 11% exhibited disease progression. The difference in progression rates in Groups 2, 3, and 4 was statistically significant. Refraction, axial length, the frequency of a posterior staphyloma, chorioretinal atrophy, initial BCVA, final BCVA, and retinal sensitivity all differed significantly among Groups 1-4. Conclusions. Long axial length, chorioretinal atrophy, a posterior staphyloma, and anterior traction contribute to MTM development. Patients with high myopia and unilateral MTM require regular OCT monitoring of the fellow eye to assess progression to myopic pre-MTM. For cases exhibiting one or more potential risk factors, early surgical intervention may maximize the visual outcomes.\n"

      "METHOD: The concentrations of MMP-1 and MMP-9 in the aqueous humors of 15 cataract patients and 25 DME patients were compared. DME patients were analyzed according to the diabetic retinopathy (DR) stage, diabetes mellitus (DM) duration, pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment, recurrence within 3 months, HbA1C (glycated hemoglobin) level, and axial length.\n",
      "RESULTS: The concentrations of MMP-1 and MMP-9 of the DME groups were higher than those of the control group (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively). There was a significant difference in MMP-1 concentration between the mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) group and the proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) group (p = 0.012). MMP-1 concentrations were elevated in PRP-treated patients (p = 0.005).

The change between final and baseline mean IOPs also revealed no significant differences: 0.54 mmHg, -1.28 mmHg, -0.33 mmHg for the 0.125 % atropine, 0.25 % atropine and control groups. The baseline mean spherical equivalent similarly did not differ significantly among groups but the control group showed a significant myopic progression compared to the 0.125 % atropine group 6 months after treatment, and persisted for one year. The change between final and baseline mean spherical equivalents were -0.05 D, 0 D, -1.05 D for the 0.125 % atropine, 0.25 % atropine and control groups, with both atropine-treated groups showing significant myopic retardation compared to the control group.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Topical use of low concentration atropine for one year does not induce ocular hypertension and is effective for retarding myopic progression. However, further large scale studies with longer follow up period is necessary to validate the long term safety and efficacy.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To determine the risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Algerians, and compare these data with those on North Africans living in Italy.\n",
      "METHODS: All patients over 55 years of age consulting one of the 23 involved Algerian ophthalmologists were invited to participate, and 1,183 patients were included. Data collection was standardized based on the Simplified Théa Risk Assessment Scale (STARS) questionnaire. A similar study was conducted in North Africans living in Italy (n = 1,011). Patients with only soft drusen and/or pigmentary abnormalities were classified as early AMD, and patients with geographic atrophy and/or neovascular AMD were classified as late AMD.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the final multivariate model, risk for early and/or late AMD was significantly increased with older age, family history of AMD, Black ethnicity, atherosclerosis, beer consumption, high fruit consumption, cataract surgery, myopia, and hyperopia. High consumption of green vegetables was associated with lower risk for both early and late AMD. In comparison with North Africans from Italy, Algerians generally had a healthier profile (younger, less obesity, smoking, and cardiovascular diseases, and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables) and a lower risk for AMD.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study documents risk factors for AMD in North-African populations for the first time.\n",

      " Late-onset Hypotony Maculopathy After Trabeculectomy in a Highly Myopic Patient With Juvenile Open-angle Glaucoma.\n",
      "Hypotony maculopathy is a sight-threatening complication after trabeculectomy. We report on a 34-year-old man with juvenile open-angle glaucoma and high myopia, who developed hypotony maculopathy 14 years after trabeculectomy without bleb leak. This represents the longest known period from trabeculectomy to the development of hypotony maculopathy without bleb leak. The possible mechanisms for the development of late-onset hypotony maculopathy in the highly myopic patient are progressive scleral thinning, reduced scleral rigidity, and scleral morphologic change with aging. These changes might weaken the biomechanical properties of sclera and then contribute to the collapse of the scleral wall during hypotony. This case serves as a reminder that hypotony maculopathy can happen up to 14 years after tabeculectomy even without bleb leak and hypotony should be avoided after trabeculectomy in highly myopic patients with juvenile open-angle glaucoma.\n"

      "METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 10 eyes of 8 patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with CNV. The main clinical parameters included predisposing ocular pathologies, best-corrected visual acuity before and after treatment, characteristics of CNV, and treatment modalities.\n",
      "RESULTS: Two boys and 6 girls with CNV and a mean age of 13.9 years (SD 1.9, range 11-16 years) were included. Two patients developed bilateral CNV within the follow-up time. The development of CNV was secondary to the following pathologies: choroidal osteoma (n = 3), pathologic myopia (n = 1), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 1), hereditary macular dystrophy (n = 2), and angioid streaks (n = 1). Idiopathic CNV was diagnosed in 2 children without any obvious associated ocular pathology. In 9 eyes, CNV was treated by intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) administration (n = 6), photodynamic therapy (n = 1), or combination therapy (n = 3). One eye remained untreated because of advanced disease.\n",

      " Management of Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization: Focus on Anti-VEGF Therapy.\n",
      "Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) is the second most common form of CNV after age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is a sight-threatening complication of pathologic myopia (PM) and often affects patients in their working years causing significant impact on quality of life. Previous therapies such as photodynamic therapy with verteporfin have shown limited success. Due to the similarities in pathogenesis of mCNV and AMD CNV, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF), which has so far been the mainstay of treatment for AMD CNV, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mCNV and has become the first-line treatment of choice. This article aims to examine briefly the epidemiology and pathophysiology of mCNV, as well as review the evidence for efficacy, safety, and clinical use of anti-VEGF treatment for mCNV.\n",

      " Subretinal Hyperreflective Material Imaged With Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The range of subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM) seen in macular disease includes type 2 macular neovascularization, fibrosis, exudation, vitelliform material, and hemorrhage. The prognostic significance of SHRM has been evaluated retrospectively in clinical trials, but discriminating SHRM subtypes traditionally requires multiple imaging modalities. The purpose of this study is to describe optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) flow characteristics and artifacts that might help to distinguish SHRM subtypes.\n",
      "DESIGN: Validity analysis.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), myopia, pachychoroid disease, and macular dystrophy, manifesting SHRM on optical coherence tomography (OCT), were recruited. Clinical chart review and multimodal imaging established the SHRM subtype. All patients underwent OCTA. OCT and OCTA images were examined together for (1) intrinsic flow, (2) retinal projection onto the anterior SHRM surface (strong, weak, absent), (3) retinal projection through SHRM onto retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and (4) masking of choriocapillaris flow.\n",
      "RESULTS: Thirty-three eyes of 25 patients were included (type 2 neovascularization ×3; fibrosis ×4; exudation ×10; hemorrhage ×5; vitelliform ×17). Mean age per eye was 76 years (standard deviation: 12). Intrinsic flow was strongest in type 2 neovascularization. Subretinal fibrosis showed limited flow in residual large-caliber vessels and branches. Flow was not detected within foci of exudation, hemorrhage, or vitelliform lesions. Retina-SHRM surface projection was strongest onto smooth-surfaced SHRM and weaker onto exudation. Retinal projection was weakest on the surface of vitelliform lesions. Retina-RPE projection was masked by dense hemorrhage and vitelliform material. In compound SHRM, OCTA distinguished between vascular and avascular components.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography angiography can distinguish vascular from avascular SHRM components. OCTA artifacts may distinguish certain avascular SHRM components.\n"

      "The aim of the study was to evaluate macular thickness and macular volume in unilateral and bilateral exfoliation syndrome and to compare them with exfoliative glaucoma and control eyes using optical coherence tomography. This prospective study included 114 subjects (228 eyes) divided into 4 groups according to the presence of exfoliation: 30 patients with unilateral syndrome, 24 patients with bilateral syndrome, 28 patients with bilateral glaucoma and control group without glaucoma or exfoliation syndrome (32 subjects). All subjects were older than 50 years. Patients with visual acuity under 0.6 according to Snellen were excluded, as well as those with refraction errors, i.e. hypermetropia over +3 spherical diopters, myopia over -5 spherical diopters, astigmatism over 2 cylindrical diopters, patients with affections that might affect the macula or the optic nerve, such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, macular edema, epiretinal membrane, vascular occlusions, neuropathies, and patients having undergone eye surgery except for pseudophakic patients with visual acuity within the set limits. Study results confirmed the hypothesis on the existence of structural changes of macular parameters before the functional ones, thus representing an early sign of glaucomatous damage in risk groups such as unilateral and bilateral exfoliation syndrome. If the glaucoma had already manifested (exfoliative glaucoma in this study) with changes in optic disc and visual field, structural changes confirmed the clinical findings and warned of the disease severity.\n"

      "SUBJECTS AND METHOD: The subjects were 1174 eyes of phakic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment detected in 1199 eyes that underwent initial vitreoretinal surgery between April 2006 and March 2011. Eyes with macular hole retinal detachment or secondary retinal detachment were excluded. The 486 eyes with high myopia (spherical equivalent ≤ -6.0 D or axial length ≥ 26.5 mm) and the 688 eyes with non-high myopia were compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age was significantly younger in the high myopia group (42.7 ± 14.2 years old, p < 0.001) with a single peak of higher incidence in 40 years old. The retinal detachment caused by retinal hole was significantly frequent in the high myopia group (p < 0.001) and that caused by retinal tear was less frequent (p = 0.021). The initial retinal attachment rate and the final attachment rate were not significant. In the fellow eye of the high myopia group, the incidence of retinal detachment and lattice degeneration were more frequent (16.7%, 20.4%, respectively).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of the retinal detachment in younger age and those caused by retinal holes were higher in the high myopia group. Higher incidence of retinal detachment and lattice degeneration in the fellow eyes of the high myopia group indicated that careful observation also in the fellow eyes was recommended.\n"

      "To investigate the morphological characteristics of myopic macular retinoschisis (MRS) in teenagers with high myopia, six male (9 eyes) and 3 female (4 eyes) teenagers with typical MRS identified from chart review were evaluated. All cases underwent complete ophthalmic examinations including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), indirect ophthalmoscopy, colour fundus photography, B-type ultrasonography, axial length measurement, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The average age was 17.8 ± 1.5 years, average refractive error was -17.04 ± 3.04D, average BCVA was 0.43 ± 0.61, and average axial length was 30.42 ± 1.71 mm. Myopic macular degenerative changes (MDC) by colour fundus photographs revealed Ohno-Matsui Category 1 in 4 eyes, and Category 2 in 9 eyes. Posterior staphyloma was found in 9 eyes. SD-OCT showed outer MRS in all 13 eyes, internal limiting membrane detachment in 7 eyes, vascular microfolds in 2 eyes, and inner MRS in 1 eye. No premacular structures such as macular epiretinal membrane or partially detached posterior hyaloids were found. Our results showed that MRS rarely occurred in highly myopic teenagers, and was not accompanied by premacular structures, severe MDC, or even obvious posterior staphyloma. This finding indicates that posterior scleral expansion is probably the main cause of MRS.\n"

      "METHODS: Retrospective, multi-centre, observational case series with case note review.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eight patients with symptomatic vitreomacular traction (six with concomitant macular hole) were diagnosed with RRD after a median of 16 days (range 3-131 days) post-OCP injection. Presentation was within 3 weeks of the OCP injection in six of the cases. Five patients presented with symptoms post-OCP, and three were diagnosed asymptomatically on planned visits. Seven cases were phakic, one had high myopia (>8 dioptres), and two cases had lattice degeneration. Following RRD surgery, hole closure was achieved in 5/6 MH cases.

There is a lack of reported electrophysiologic data, and some key clinical features have yet to be described.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To expand on current clinical, electrophysiologic, and molecular genetic findings in Knobloch syndrome.\n",
      "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twelve patients from 7 families underwent full ophthalmic examination and retinal imaging. Further investigations included electroretinography and neuroradiologic imaging. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of COL18A1 was performed with segregation on available relatives. The study was conducted from July 4, 2013, to October 5, 2015. Data analysis was performed from May 20, 2014, to November 3, 2015.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Results of ophthalmic and neuroradiologic assessment and sequence analysis of COL18A1.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 12 patients (6 males; mean age at last review, 16 years [range, 2-38 years]), all had high myopia in at least 1 eye and severely reduced vision. A sibling pair had unilateral high myopia in their right eyes and near emmetropia in their left eyes from infancy. Anterior segment abnormalities included absent iris crypts, iris transillumination, lens subluxation, and cataract. Two patients with iris transillumination had glaucoma. Fundus characteristics included abnormal collapsed vitreous, macular atrophy, and a tesselated fundus. Five patients had previous retinal detachment. Electroretinography revealed a cone-rod pattern of dysfunction in 8 patients, was severely reduced or undetectable in 2 patients, and demonstrated cone-rod dysfunction in 1 eye with undetectable responses in the other eye in 2 patients. Radiologic imaging demonstrated occipital encephalocele or meningocele in 3 patients, occipital skull defects in 4 patients, minor occipital changes in 2 patients, and no abnormalities in 2 patients. Cutaneous scalp changes were present in 5 patients. Systemic associations were identified in 8 patients, including learning difficulties, epilepsy, and congenital renal abnormalities. Biallelic mutations including 2 likely novel mutations in COL18A1, were identified in 6 families that were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance with a single mutation identified in a family with 2 affected children.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This report describes new features in patients with Knobloch syndrome, including pigment dispersion syndrome and glaucoma as well as cone-rod dysfunction on electroretinography. Two patients had normal neuroradiologic findings, emphasizing that some affected individuals have isolated ocular disease. Awareness of the ocular phenotype may aid early diagnosis, appropriate genetic counseling, and monitoring for potential complications.\n"

      "We report a 34-years-old woman who presented with bilateral incongruous inferior visual field defects after the commencement of topiramate for management of migraine. Investigations did not reveal any underlying angle closure glaucoma, reported in current literature to be associated commonly with topiramate associated visual field defects. The changes in the peripheral visual fields gradually improved over several months after the medication was withdrawn. There were only minor changes persistent on the left side on a background of pre-existing myopia and keratoconus. Visual field deficits secondary to topiramate are more commonly attributed to angle closure glaucoma due to ciliochoroidal effusion syndrome. In such instance, the visual field defects are associated with considerable pain due to raised intra-ocular pressure. There have also been reports of visual scotomas due to retinal damage and maculopathy in patients taking topiramate. It is worthwhile to obtain a baseline perimetry in patients being considered for topiramate therapy in order to gauge any changes in their peripheral field of vision during the treatment. Changes in visual fields during the course of medication use and after cessation can be easily compared especially if there are other possible confounders such as refractive errors or a history of migraine.\n"

      "PURPOSE: Describe the first 3 years of highly specialized retinal screening through a web platform using a retinologists' network for image reading.\n",
      "METHODS: All patients who came to centers in the network and consented to fundus photography were included. Images were evaluated by ophthalmologists. We describe number of patients, age, visual acuity, retinal abnormalities, medical recommendations, and factors associated with abnormal retinographies.\n",
      "RESULTS: Fifty thousand three hundred eighty-four patients were included; mean age 52.3 years (range 3-99). Mean visual acuity 20/25. Of the total cohort, 75% had normal retinographies, 22% had abnormalities, 1% referred acute floaters, 1% referred acute symptoms with normal retinography, and 1% could not be assessed. Ophthalmological referral was recommended in 12,634 patients: 9% urgent visit, 11% preferential (2-3 weeks), and 80% an ordinary visit. Age-related maculopathy signs were the most common abnormalities (2,456 patients, 4.8%). Epiretinal membrane was the second (764 cases, 1.5%). Diabetic retinopathy was suspected in 543 patients (1%), and nevi in 358 patients (0.7%). Patients older than 50 years had significantly more retinal abnormalities (31.5%) than younger ones (11.1%) (p < 0.0001; odds ratio [OR] 2.47; confidence interval [CI] 2.37-2.57). Patients with almost one eye with a myopic defect greater than -5 spherical equivalent had a higher risk of presenting abnormalities (p < 0.001; OR 1.04; CI 1.03-1.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of asymptomatic retinal abnormalities was detected in this general screening, justifying this practice. Many patients who visit optometrists in Spain are unaware that they would benefit from ophthalmological monitoring. The ophthalmic community should lead initiatives of the type presented to preserve and guarantee quality standards.\n"

      " Peripapillary Diffuse Chorioretinal Atrophy in Children as a Sign of Eventual Pathologic Myopia in Adults.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To search for a morphologic biomarker to differentiate between pathologic myopia and simple childhood myopia.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective case series.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: The study included children (age ≤15 years) with high myopia (as defined by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare) who attended the High Myopia Clinic between April 1982 and March 1994, had undergone fundus photography, and had a follow-up of 20 years or more.\n",
      "METHODS: Fundus photographs obtained in childhood and adulthood were examined for presence of pathologic myopia, defined by high myopia (myopic refractive error >8 diopters or axial length ≥26.5 mm) and the presence of stage 2 or higher myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Myopic maculopathy in childhood.\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 56 eyes of 29 patients with a mean age of 10.2±3.6 years at the initial visit and an age of 36.0±7.6 years at the last visit. Mean axial length was 27.0±1.4 mm at baseline and 29.7±2.0 mm at the last visit. At the last visit, 19 eyes (34%) had tessellated fundus alone, 31 eyes (55%) had diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, 3 eyes (5%) showed patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and 1 eye (2%) had macular atrophy. Thus, 35 eyes (63%) had pathologic myopia in adulthood. Among the 35 eyes, 29 (83%) already had diffuse chorioretinal atrophy at the initial visit in childhood and the remaining 6 eyes (17%) showed tessellated fundus in childhood. The diffuse chorioretinal atrophy seen in childhood was restricted to the area temporal to the peripapillary region.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The presence of peripapillary diffuse chorioretinal atrophy in children with high axial myopia may be an indicator for the eventual development of advanced myopic chorioretinal atrophy in later life. These features in children may be helpful for differentiating simple childhood myopia from eventual pathologic myopia.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is an established treatment for various retinal diseases. Long-term data on injection frequencies and visual acuity (VA), however, are still rare.\n",
      "METHODS: Five-year analysis of real-life VA developments and injection patterns from 2072 patients (2577 eyes; 33 187 injections) with chronically active disease undergoing pro-re-nata treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV).\n",
      "RESULTS: Maximum mean VA gain in year 1 was+5.2 letters in AMD, +6.2 in DME, +10 in RVO and+7.2 in myopic CNV. Over 5 years, however, VA in patients with AMD declined. By year 5, 34% of patients with AMD had experienced VA loss of >15 letters, 56% had remained stable and 10% had gained >15 letters. Long-term VA developments in DME and RVO were more favourable with 81% of DME and 79% of patients with RVO gaining or maintaining vision at 5 years. In AMD, median injection frequency was six in year 1 and between four and five in consecutive years. In DME and RVO, median injection frequency was six in year 1 but lower compared with AMD in consecutive years. Injection frequency in DME was weakly associated with patient age (r\n",

      "The ocular manifestations of Marfan's syndrome (MS) range from ectopia lentis, microspherophakia, myopia, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Spontaneous scleral rupture is a rare complication and recurrent scleral perforation is extremely rare. We report a rare case of a 26-year-old male with MS who had sequential recurrent spontaneous scleral rupture which required surgical repair. He suffered from a similar problem 4 years later in both eyes in a different location, with overlying thin cystic blebs and hypotony maculopathy. Surgical repair with preserved scleral donor patch graft and conjunctival autograft in one eye, and conjunctival advancement in the other eye was performed. This helped stabilise the eyes, and resulted in complete visual recovery in both eyes.\n",

      " Education-Related Parameters in High Myopia: Adults versus School Children.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Since high myopia in the younger generation may differ etiologically from high myopia in older generations, we examined whether education-related parameters differ between high myopia in today´s school children and high pathological myopia in today´s elderly generation.\n",
      "METHODS: The investigation included the adult populations of the population-based Beijing Eye Study (BES) (3468 adults;mean age:64.6±9.8years;range:50-93years) and Central India Eye and Medical Study (CIEMS) (4711 adults;age:49.±13.2years;range:30-100years), and the children and teenager populations of the Shandong Children Eye Study (SCES) (6026 children;age:9.7±3.3years;range:4-18years;cycloplegic refractometry), Gobi Desert Children Eye Study (1565;age:11.9±3.5years;range:6-21 years;cycloplegic refractometry), Beijing Pediatric Eye Study (681 children;age:7.7±1.6years;range:5-13 years;non-cycloplegic refractometry,calculation of axial length to corneal curvature radius ratio), Beijing Children Eye Study (15066 children;age:13.2±3.4years;range:7-18years;non-cycloplegic refractometry), Beijing High School Teenager Eye Study (4677 children;age:16.9±0.7years;range:16-18years;non-cycloplegic refractometry).\n",
      "RESULTS: In the BES and CIEMS, educational level did not differ significantly between, or was significantly lower in the highly myopic group (myopic refractive error ≥6 diopters) than in the non-highly myopic group. In all non-adult study populations, higher prevalence of high myopia was significantly associated with higher degree of education related parameters such as attendance of high-level schools, and more time spent for indoors near work versus time spent outdoors.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Comparing associations of old or genetic high myopia in adults with new or acquired high myopia in school children revealed that education-related parameters did not show a clear association with old or genetic high myopia, while in contrast, new high myopia showed strong associations with education. It confirms previous studies that the two forms of high myopia not only differed in age of onset, but also in associations with education as well. The data support the notion of two types of high myopia. Future studies may assess whether the risk of pathologic myopic maculopathy and high myopia associated open-angle glaucoma differs between both types of high myopia.\n"

      " Biometry, optical coherence tomography, and further clinical observations in Knobloch syndrome.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Knobloch syndrome is a pathognomonic vitreo-retinopathy that includes zonular weakness, high myopia, and a distinct fundus appearance with tessellation out of proportion to the degree of myopia. Whether myopia in Knobloch syndrome is axial or lenticular is unclear. Also not known are the optical coherence tomography (OCT) correlates to the distinct fundus appearance. In this study we assess cycloplegic refraction, biometry, and macular spectral domain (SD) OCT in children with Knobloch syndrome.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective case series of seven children (12 eyes) with Knobloch syndrome.\n",
      "RESULTS: Twelve eyes with attached retinas (seven patients, aged 6-17 years old, mean 11 years) were identified, seven of which had OCT. Best-corrected vision was typically 20/300 or worse. Axial length divided by corneal radius was >3 for all eyes (3.23-3.77, mean 3.52), consistent with axial myopia, and axial lengths (26.58-30.27 mm, mean 28.16) were consistent with spherical equivalent degree of myopia (-10.00 to -18.50, mean -12) when compared to historical controls. OCT revealed lack of choriocapillaries, outer retinal disorganization, and lack of or only rudimentary foveal pit.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Refractions and biometry in Knobloch syndrome are consistent with the myopia being axial. In addition to vitreo-retinopathy, choroidopathy is part of the phenotype and is an anatomical correlate to the distinctive fundus appearance.\n"

      " Advances of optical coherence tomography in myopia and pathologic myopia.\n",
      "The natural course of high-axial myopia is variable and the development of pathologic myopia is not fully understood. Advancements in optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology have revealed peculiar intraocular structures in highly myopic eyes and unprecedented pathologies that cause visual impairment. New OCT findings include posterior precortical vitreous pocket and precursor stages of posterior vitreous detachment; peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation; morphological patterns of scleral inner curvature and dome-shaped macula. Swept source OCT is capable of imaging deeper layers in the posterior pole for investigation of optic nerve pits, stretched and thinned lamina cribrosa, elongated dural attachment at posterior scleral canal, and enlargement of retrobulbar subarachnoid spaces. This has therefore enabled further evaluation of various visual field defects in high myopia and the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. OCT has many potential clinical uses in managing visual impairing conditions in pathologic myopia. Understanding how retinal nerve fibers are redistributed in axial elongation will allow the development of auto-segmentation software for diagnosis and monitoring progression of glaucoma. OCT is indispensable in the diagnosis of various conditions associated with myopic traction maculopathy and monitoring of post-surgical outcomes. In addition, OCT is commonly used in the multimodal imaging assessment of myopic choroidal neovascularization. Biometry and topography of the retinal layers and choroid will soon be validated for the classification of myopic maculopathy for utilization in epidemiological studies as well as clinical trials.\n"

      " Association between SCO2 mutation and extreme myopia in Japanese patients.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the role of SCO2 in extreme myopia of Japanese patients.\n",
      "METHODS: In total, 101 Japanese patients with extreme myopia (axial length of ≥30 mm) OU at the Kyoto University Hospital were included in this study. Exon 2 of SCO2 was sequenced by conventional Sanger sequencing. The detected variants were assessed using in silico prediction programs: SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster. To determine the frequency of the mutations in normal subjects, we referred to the 1000 Genomes Project data and the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) in the Human Genetic Variation Browser.\n",
      "RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 62.9 ± 12.7 years. There were 31 males (30.7 %) and 70 females. Axial lengths were 31.76 ± 1.17 mm OD and 31.40 ± 1.07 mm OS, and 176 eyes (87.6 %) out of 201 eyes had myopic maculopathy of grade 2 or more. Among the 101 extremely myopic patients, one mutation (c.290 C > T;p.Ala97Val) in SCO2 was detected. This mutation was not found in the 1000 Genomes Project data or HGVD data. Variant type of the mutation was nonsynonymous. Although the SIFT prediction score was 0.350, the PolyPhen-2 probability was 0.846, thus predicting its pathogenicity to be possibly damaging. MutationTaster PhyloP was 1.268, suggesting that the mutation is conserved.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We identified one novel possibility of an extreme myopia-causing mutation in SCO2. No other disease-causing mutation was found in 101 extremely myopic Japanese patients, suggesting that SCO2 plays a limited role in Japanese extreme myopia. Further investigation is required for better understanding of extreme myopia.\n"

      "INTRODUCTION: Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the most common cause of CNV in those under 50 years of age. It is a significant cause of visual loss in those with pathologic myopia. The current standard of care involves therapy with intravitreal inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n",
      "AREAS COVERED: The epidemiology of myopia, high myopia, pathologic myopia, and myopic CNV is reviewed, along with a brief discussion of historical treatments. The pharmacology of the three most commonly used anti-VEGF agents is discussed, with an emphasis on the licensed drugs, ranibizumab and aflibercept. A comprehensive clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment of myopic CNV is presented.\n",
      "EXPERT OPINION: The current standard of care for myopic CNV is intravitreal inhibition of VEGF, with ranibizumab and aflibercept licensed for intraocular use. The diagnosis, OCT features of disease activity and retreatment algorithm for myopic CNV is different from wet age-related macular degeneration. In the long-term, myopic CNV may be associated with gradual, irreversible visual loss due to progressive chorioretinal atrophy, for which there is currently no treatment.\n",

      " Refractive Error and the Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration in the South Korean Population.\n",
      "PURPOSE: We investigated the association between refractive error and the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a population-based study.\n",
      "DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study.\n",
      "METHODS: Right eyes were included from 14,067 participants aged 40 years and older with gradable fundus photographs and refraction data from the fourth and the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008 to 2011. Early and late AMD was graded based on the International Age-Related Maculopathy Epidemiological Study Group grading system. Autorefraction data were collected to calculate spherical equivalent refraction in diopters (D) and classified into 4 groups: hyperopia (≥1.0 D), emmetropia (-0.99 to 0.99 D), mild myopia (-1.0 to -2.99 D), and moderate to high myopia (≤-3.0 D).\n",
      "RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, each diopter increase in spherical equivalent was associated with a 16% [odds ratio (OR), 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.25] and 18% (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.27) increased risk of any (early + late) and early AMD, respectively. Mild and moderate to high myopia were associated with lower odds of any and early AMD compared with hyperopia (any AMD: OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.4-0.95 for mild myopia; OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.81 for moderate to high myopia; early AMD: OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.4-0.99 for mild myopia; OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.77 for moderate to high myopia group). There was no association between refractive status and the likelihood of late AMD (P = 0.91).\n",

      "DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3811 participants, aged 46 to 86 years, from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, with retinal data collected twice, on average, 8 years apart.\n",
      "METHODS: Fundus images, taken using a digital camera through dark-adapted pupils using a standard protocol and the same equipment at both study visits, were graded centrally for early and late AMD on the basis of drusen size, type and area, increased retinal pigment, retinal pigment epithelial depigmentation, neovascular lesions, and geographic atrophy using the modified Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory measures were included in multivariable regression models to determine their impact on the variation in AMD incidence among racial/ethnic groups.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident early and late AMD.\n",
      "RESULTS: The overall 8-year age- and sex-standardized incidence of early and late AMD were 4.1% and 2.3%, respectively, with incidence of early and late AMD highest in whites (5.3% and 4.1%, respectively), intermediate in Chinese (4.5% and 2.2%, respectively) and Hispanics (3.3% and 0.8%, respectively), and lowest in blacks (1.6% and 0.4%, respectively). By adjusting for age and sex, blacks had a 70% lower risk of developing early AMD than whites, and this decreased only slightly to a 67% lower risk after multivariable adjustment. By adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, hyperopia was associated with early AMD (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.20), as was astigmatism (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.00-2.16), but not myopia (P = 0.29). Age, race/ethnicity, current smoking, hyperopia, and AMD-susceptibility genotypes Complement Factor H (CFH) RS1061170 and Age Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) RS3793917 were independently associated with incident early AMD in multivariable models for the combined sample. However, the only statistically significant factor consistently associated with incident early AMD across the 4 racial/ethnic groups was increasing age. Risk factors for late AMD were not assessed because of its low incidence, particularly across racial/ethnic groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Variation in the incidence of early AMD exists among racial/ethnic groups in the United States and is not explained by the clinical, genetic, and environmental factors included in this study.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Foveal detachment associated with foveoschisis usually takes a progressive course, and is associated with a poor visual outcome. The purpose of this study was to report the spontaneous resolution of foveal detachment in patients with myopic traction maculopathy without posterior vitreous detachment.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective study involving eight cases of high myopia with foveoschisis and foveal detachment in which the subfoveal fluid had spontaneously resolved. The clinical characteristics and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings were described.\n",
      "RESULTS: All cases involved predominant schisis in the outer retina, with six showing internal limiting membrane detachment. The average central foveal thickness was 445.1 μm, and the average foveal detachment height was 271.5 μm. None of the cases involved traction of the vitreomacular interface or posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), either before or after the resolution of foveal detachment. In seven cases, the mean best-corrected visual acuity improved after foveal reattachment.\n",

      "DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-eight glaucomatous and healthy eyes from 290 subjects with OCT-measured macular GCIPL thickness were enrolled. Eyes with macular disorders, including epiretinal membrane, macular degeneration, macular hole, and myopic maculopathy, were excluded.\n",
      "METHODS: By inspecting 128 cross-sectional OCT B-scan images per eye, the presence (yes vs. no), layer (anterior vs. posterior border), location (quadrants), and area (diffuse vs. focal) of macular GCIPL segmentation error were investigated. The effects of age, refractive error, mean deviation of visual field test, circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness obtained by OCT, and signal strength of OCT scan on the presence of macular GCIPL segmentation errors were evaluated. In eyes with segmentation errors, repeated OCT examinations were performed to investigate the reproducibility of the segmentation errors.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence, features, associated factors, and reproducibility of macular GCIPL segmentation errors were assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among the 538 eyes, 52 eyes (9.7%) showed segmentation errors in macular GCIPL thickness measurement. The most common features of segmentation errors were that they affected both the anterior and posterior borders, were located at the nasal quadrant (centered to the fovea), and were diffuse. In univariate analysis, the presence of segmentation error was associated significantly with younger age (P < 0.001), higher degree of myopia (P < 0.001), and lower signal strength of OCT scan (P = 0.038). In multivariate analysis, only higher degree of myopia was associated significantly with the presence of segmentation error (P < 0.001). In repeated examinations, segmentation errors were reproducible in 24 eyes (46.2%). In other cases, the features of segmentation errors changed or disappeared.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Although the OCT segmentation algorithm accurately detected macular GCIPL thickness in most eyes without macular disorders, in some cases, segmentation errors were found, especially in myopic eyes. In repeated examinations, approximately half of the errors were nonreproducible. These findings should be considered when assessing macular GCIPL thickness using OCT.\n"

      " Myopic Maculopathy and Optic Disc Changes in Highly Myopic Young Asian Eyes and Impact on Visual Acuity.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of myopic maculopathy and specific optic disc and macular changes in highly myopic eyes of young Asian adults and their impact on visual acuity.\n",
      "DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study.\n",
      "METHODS: In total, 593 highly myopic (spherical equivalent refraction [SER] less than -6.00 diopters [D]) and 156 emmetropic (SER between -1.00 and +1.00 D) male participants from a population-based survey were included. All participants underwent standardized medical interviews, ophthalmic examination, and color fundus photographs. These photographs were graded systematically to determine the presence of optic disc and macular lesions. Myopic maculopathy was classified based on the International Classification of Myopic Maculopathy.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age was 21.1 ± 1.2 years. The mean SER for the highly myopic and emmetropic group was -8.87 ± 2.11 D and 0.40 ± 0.39 D, respectively (P < .001). Compared to emmetropic eyes, highly myopic eyes were significantly more likely to have optic disc tilt, peripapillary atrophy (PPA), posterior staphyloma, chorioretinal atrophy, and myopic maculopathy (all P < .001). The main findings included PPA (98.3%), disc tilt (22.0%), posterior staphyloma (32.0%), and chorioretinal atrophy (8.3%). Myopic maculopathy was present in 8.3% of highly myopic eyes and was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.66; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.26), reduced choroidal thickness (OR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.99), and increased axial length (AL) (OR 1.52; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.19). The presence of disc tilt, posterior staphyloma, and chorioretinal atrophy were associated with reduced visual acuity.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that myopia-related changes of the optic disc and macula were common in highly myopic eyes even at a young age. The risk factors for myopic maculopathy include increased age, longer AL, and reduced choroidal thickness. Some of these changes were associated with reduced central visual function.\n",

      " Interleukin-17A Induces IL-1β Secretion From RPE Cells Via the NLRP3 Inflammasome.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Inflammasome activation and IL-1β production have been proposed to have an important role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Growing evidence is emerging for involvement of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in AMD pathogenesis. We investigated the effects of IL-17A on the activation of inflammasome and production of IL-1β in primary human RPE cells.\n",
      "METHODS: Primary human RPE cells were isolated and cultured for the following experiments. Expression patterns of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC), and ACT1 were analyzed by RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. IL-17A was added to the cell cultures, and cytokine expression, signaling pathways, and inflammasome machinery were investigated using real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot, flow cytometry, and small interfering RNA.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinal pigment epithelial cells constitutively expressed IL-17RA, IL-17RC, and ACT1. IL-17A upregulated the mRNA levels of pro-IL-1β, IL-8, CCL2, and CCL20, as well as the protein level of IL-1β. IL-17A induced the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB p65 in RPE cells. Blocking NF-κB attenuated IL-17A-induced expression of pro-IL-1β mRNA. IL-17A enhanced pro-caspase-1 and NLRP3 mRNA expression. Inhibiting caspase-1 activity and silencing NLRP3 decreased IL-1β secretion, confirming NLRP3 as the IL-17A-responsive inflammasome on the posttranscriptional level. The mechanism of IL-17A-triggered NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion was found to involve the generation of reactive oxygen species.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IL-17A triggers a key inflammatory mediator, IL-1β, from RPE cells, via NLRP3 inflammasome activation, holding therapeutic potential for AMD.\n"

      " MACULAR BRUCH MEMBRANE DEFECTS IN HIGHLY MYOPIC EYES: The Beijing Eye Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To examine prevalence and associations of macular Bruch membrane defects (MBMDs) in a population-based setting.\n",
      "DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study.\n",
      "METHODS: The Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3,468 subjects who underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination including spectral domain optical coherence tomography with enhanced depth imaging of the macula. Macular Bruch membrane defects were defined as an interruption of Bruch membrane on the optical coherence tomography images in the macular region.\n",
      "RESULTS: Macular Bruch membrane defects could be detected only in highly myopic eyes (defined as refractive error of ≤-6 diopters or axial length of ≥26.5 mm) with a prevalence of 17/164 (10.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7%-18.1%). Best-corrected visual acuity <0.05 was found in 5 (29%) of 17 eyes with MBMDs, and in 7 (41%) eyes, visual acuity was <0.3 and ≥0.05. In the MBMD region, retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris were completely lost, and the deep and middle layers of the retina and the choroid were almost completely absent. In the MBMD region, mean retinal thickness was 153 ± 57 μm (mean ± SD) and choroidal thickness was 12.7 ± 28.1 μm. On the fundus photographs, MBMDs appeared as whitish areas with round borders. In multivariate regression analysis, presence of MBMD was significantly associated only with longer axial length (Odds ratio: 3.87; 95% CI, 1.64-9.14).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Macular Bruch membrane defects with a prevalence of approximately 10% in highly myopic eyes are associated with a complete loss of retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris, an almost complete loss of photoreceptors and choroid, and marked reduction in visual acuity. Macular Bruch membrane defects may be added to the panoply of features of myopic maculopathy.\n"

      " Updates of pathologic myopia.\n",
      "Complications from pathologic myopia are a major cause of visual impairment and blindness, especially in east Asia. The eyes with pathologic myopia may develop loss of the best-corrected vision due to various pathologies in the macula, peripheral retina and the optic nerve. Despite its importance, the definition of pathologic myopia has been inconsistent. The refractive error or axial length alone often does not adequately reflect the 'pathologic myopia'. Posterior staphyloma, which is a hallmark lesion of pathologic myopia, can occur also in non-highly myopic eyes. Recently a revised classification system for myopic maculopathy has been proposed to standardize the definition among epidemiological studies. In this META-PM (meta analyses of pathologic myopia) study classification, pathologic myopia was defined as the eyes having chorioretinal atrophy equal to or more severe than diffuse atrophy. In addition, the advent of new imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and three dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) has enabled the detailed observation of various pathologies specific to pathologic myopia. New therapeutic approaches including intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents and the advance of vitreoretinal surgeries have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with pathologic myopia. The purpose of this review article is to provide an update on topics related to the field of pathologic myopia, and to outline the remaining issues which need to be solved in the future.\n",

      " Multiple ocular diseases detection based on joint sparse multi-task learning.\n",
      "In this paper, we present a multiple ocular diseases detection scheme based on joint sparse multi-task learning. Glaucoma, Pathological Myopia (PM), and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) are three major causes of vision impairment and blindness worldwide. The proposed joint sparse multitask learning framework aims to reconstruct a test fundus image with multiple features from as few training subjects as possible. The linear version of this problem could be casted into a multi-task joint covariate selection model, which can be very efficiently optimized via kernelizable accelerated proximal gradient method. Extensive experiments are conducted in order to validate the proposed framework on the SiMES dataset. From the Area Under Curve (AUC) results in multiple ocular diseases classification, our method is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To report the outcomes of cataract surgery at a large referral eye hospital and to identify factors associated with less than excellent visual outcomes.\n",
      "METHODS: Hospital records of patients, who had undergone age-related cataract extraction (1,285 procedures) within a two-year period were sampled randomly for 353 patients (405 eyes) and baseline characteristics were recorded. Up to three causes of visual loss (contributory reasons) were considered and the principal cause of \"less than excellent outcome,\" i.e., best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) <20/25 was defined as the primary reason.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 68.6 years, and 50.7% of enrolled subjects were female. Phacoemulsification had been performed in 92.1% of cases. Out of 405 eyes, 54%, 78%, and 97% achieved BSCVA of ≥20/25, ≥20/40, and ≥20/200, respectively. Poor visual outcomes were significantly associated with older age (OR: 4.55 for age >70 years), female gender (OR: 4.64), ocular comorbidities (OR: 7.68), surgically challenging eyes (OR: 7.33), long and short eyes (versus eyes with normal axial length, OR: 3.24), and being operated on by a novice surgeon (OR: 2.41). The leading contributory reasons for unfavorable outcome, in descending order were maculopathy (17%), posterior capsule opacification (PCO, 11.8%), corneal opacity (5.7%), and degenerative myopia (5.4%).\n",

      " [Modern views on myopic maculopathy].\n",
      "Most of world's scientists consider the fast-growing incidence of myopia a problem of great social importance due to associated increase in complicated myopia that leads to disability among the working-age population. This is a review on complicated myopia and myopic maculopathy that covers the history of research in this field, principles of classification, and etiological factors. It also deals with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which often follows, and its treatment options, including anti-VEGF therapy. Possible complications of the latter are described as well. Literature search was done using PubMed, eLIBRARY, and Scopus text databases. A total of 61 sources, both Russian and foreign, were analyzed. Current clinical knowledge of different types of myopic maculopathy is still insufficient and the gaps are likely to be filled using modern methods of detailed in vivo examination of both sclera and choroidea. Anti-VEGF therapy has proved most effective in treating myopic maculopathy-associated neovascularization, however, a systematic approach to patient selection and management is yet needed.\n",

      " Risk Factors and Incidence of Macular Edema after Cataract Surgery: A Database Study of 81984 Eyes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To define the incidence of pseudophakic macular edema (PME) after cataract surgery and to identify contributory risk factors.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective database study of electronic medical records (EMRs).\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 81984 eyes undergoing cataract surgery between December 2010 and December 2014 from 8 independent United Kingdom clinical sites.\n",
      "METHODS: Structured clinical data mandated by the EMR were anonymized and extracted for each eye undergoing cataract surgery including: perioperative visual acuity, copathologic features, simultaneous surgical procedures, and the presence or absence of a specified list of intraoperative complications. Diabetic status with matched Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grading also was mandated by the EMR. Eyes receiving prophylactic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were excluded.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnosis of cystoid macular edema or new-onset macular edema in patients with diabetes, recorded by a healthcare professional within 90 days of surgery.\n",
      "RESULTS: Baseline incidence of PME in eyes without operative complications, diabetes, or risk factors was 1.17%. Eyes in which PME developed were more likely to be male, older, and to demonstrate risk factors. The relative risk (RR) was increased in eyes with capsule rupture with or without vitreous loss (RR, 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-4.34), a previous diagnosis of epiretinal membrane (RR, 5.60; 95% CI, 3.45-9.07), uveitis (RR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.50-5.51), retinal vein occlusion (RR, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.56-5.92), or retinal detachment repair (RR, 3.93; 95% CI, 2.60-5.92). High myopia, age-related macular degeneration, or prostaglandin analog use were not shown to increase risk. Eyes with PME on average had poorer postoperative visual acuity, which persisted to the latest time point assessed, up to 24 weeks. Eyes from patients with diabetes, even in the absence of retinopathy, had an increased RR (RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.36-2.36) of new macular edema after surgery. The risk was higher in the presence of any diabetic retinopathy (DR; RR, 6.23; 95% CI, 5.12-7.58) and rose proportionately with increasing severity of DR.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Pseudophakic macular edema occurs commonly after phacoemulsification cataract surgery, even in the absence of complications and risk factors. This large retrospective study using structured EMR data quantified the RRs of PME and the risk with increasing ETDRS severity of DR. It highlights the need for prophylactic therapy, especially in those groups of eyes with the highest RRs.\n"

      "OBJECTIVE: To review the problems found after a new follow-up protocol for patients on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment.\n",
      "METHOD: Retrospective study was conducted between May 2012 and January 2013 on the clinical files, retinographies, fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF) images, and central-10 degree visual fields (VF) of patients who were referred to the Ophthalmology Department as they had started treatment with hydroxychloroquine.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients were included; 94.4% were referred from the Rheumatology Department and 5.6% from Dermatology. Mean age was 59.7 years, and 73.8% were women. All of them were on hydroxychloroquine treatment, and 300mg was the most frequent daily dose. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most common diagnosis (40.5%), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (15.9%). The mean Snellen visual acuity was 0.76, and 26 patients had lens opacities. The VF were normal in 97 patients, 8 had mild to moderate defects with no definite pattern, and in 9 the results were unreliable. Of the 51 patients older than 65years, 16 (31.4%) had altered or unreliable VF. The FAF was normal in 104 patients (82.5%), and abnormal, but consistent with ophthalmoscopic features, in 12 patients (pathological myopia, age related changes, early, middle or late age-related macular degeneration).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Visual fields as a reference test for the diagnosis of AP toxicity are not quite reliable for patients over 65. Therefore, the FAF is recommended as primary test, perhaps combined with another objective test, such as SD-OCT instead of VF.\n"

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: High myopia (HM), which affects 0.9 to 3.1% of the population, is a major cause of vision loss. The purpose of this investigation was to study and evaluate the impact of their high myopia on the daily lives of patients and to better understand their expectations in order to better meet their needs.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey was conducted between February 19 and March 21, 2014. To be eligible, patients had to have myopia of at least -8 diopters and be over 40 years of age, with or without myopic complications. Patients' degree of myopia was defined as the optical prescription of their worse eye. The 123 patients included were interviewed by phone using a questionnaire developed and validated by a scientific committee composed of experts and members of the patients' Association against myopic maculopathy (AMAM). The phone interview, semi-structured, lasted 20 minutes.\n",
      "RESULTS: On average, myopia was -11.7 diopters. Women accounted for 71% of the population, 89% of patients were under 65 years and were mostly professionals (65%). Over half of the subjects reported myopic complications; 5% of patients had choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Only 29% had been informed of the risk of CNV or maculopathy. HM was a handicap in sports for 64% of patients, in leisure activities for 51%, and in professional activities for more than a quarter (28%). Only 56% of HM patients reported living perfectly well with their condition.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first study on the daily life of people with HM aiming to analyze their social and emotional environment. It shows that HM has a profound impact on the daily lives of patients and may affect social life and professional activity. Most myopic patients possess incomplete or unclear information about the nature and risk of myopic complications. They expressed the desire to be better informed about their condition earlier, before the onset of complications.\n"

      " Platelet derived growth factor inhibitors: A potential therapeutic approach for ocular neovascularization.\n",
      "Retinochoroidal vascular diseases are the leading causes of blindness in the developed world. They include diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal vein occlusion, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and pathological myopia, among many others. Several different therapies are currently under consideration for the aforementioned disorders. In the following section, agents targeting platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are discussed as a potential therapeutic option for retinochoroidal vascular diseases. PDGF plays an important role in the angiogenesis cascade that is activated in retinochoroidal vascular diseases. The mechanism of action, side effects, efficacy, and the potential synergistic role of these agents in combination with other treatment options is discussed. The future of treatment of retinochoroidal vascular diseases, particularly AMD, has become more exciting due to agents such as PDGF antagonists.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To describe the features of posterior staphylomas in myopic eyes with an axial length shorter than 26.5 mm causing visual loss in old age.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.\n",
      "METHODS: After reviewing cases of staphyloma, we isolated 16 eyes from 10 patients with an axial length <26.5 mm for further analysis. These patients had all undergone fundus photography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) and some had undergone 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI).\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 70.0 ± 6.3 years (mean ± standard deviation; range 59-81). The mean axial length of the eyes with a posterior staphyloma was 25.14 ± 0.77 mm and the mean refractive error of the affected eyes was -4.28 ± 2.65 diopters. The median visual acuity was 20/60. All eyes presented with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, which resembles pathologic myopic maculopathy. Fuchs spots previously were detected in 3 eyes (19%) and lacquer cracks in 2 (12%). SDOCT imaging of the macula showed decreased choroidal thickness in all eyes. A macular retinoschisis was detected in 5 eyes (31%), decreased ellipsoid zone reflectivity in 4 (25%), foveal retinal detachment in 2 (12%), a dome-shaped macula in 1 (6%), a choroidal neovascularization-related subretinal scar in 3 (19%), and loss of ellipsoid zone and outer nuclear layer in 3 (19%). The 3D-MRI scans from 8 eyes showed posterior staphylomas, lateral angulation, or protrusion in all eyes. No eye featured a tilted disc syndrome.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Posterior staphylomas in myopic eyes with an axial length shorter than 26.5 mm exhibit features resembling pathologic myopic maculopathy. This type of staphyloma might cause visual impairment in elderly patients and can be considered atypical forms of pathologic myopia in old age.\n"

      "AIM The aim of this study is to evaluate long-term efficacy of intravitreal injections of aflibercept as primary treatment for subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV).METHODS Thirty-eight treatment-naive eyes of thirty-eight patients with subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic CNV received initial intravitreal aflibercept injections and were followed for at least 18 months. Aflibercept was applied again for persistent or recurrent CNV, as required. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS.RESULTS Mean patient age was 45.8 years, and mean eye refractive error was -7.79 D. For the total patient group (n=38 eyes), mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) significantly improved from 0.69 at baseline to 0.15 at 18 months (P<0.01). Over half of the treated eyes obtained resolution with one aflibercept injection. Patients were also grouped according to age, as <50 years (n=20 eyes) and ≥50 years (n=18 eyes). Mean BCVA improvement was significantly greater in eyes of the younger myopic CNV group, compared with those of ≥50 years (0.21 vs 0.35; P<0.05). The mean number of aflibercept injections was 1.8 for the <50 years myopic CNV group, and 3.6 for the ≥50 years myopic CNV group (P<0.001). Correlation between spherical equivalent refraction and final visual acuity reached statistical significance only for the <50 years myopic CNV group (P<0.001; Levene's correlation).CONCLUSIONS Intravitreal aflibercept provides long-term visual acuity improvement in myopic CNV. The <50 years old myopic CNV group had significantly fewer injections, with greater visual acuity improvement. Intravitreal aflibercept in myopic CNV does not require the three-injection loading phase used for aflibercept treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.\n"

      " Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies and Fragments: Bevacizumab.\n",
      "Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin antibody that has two antigen-binding domains and blocks all active forms of vascular endothelial growth factor-A. It was originally designed and is still in use as antitumor agent (for colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers). Besides inhibiting vessel growth and neovascularization, the drug promotes the regression of existing microvessels and induces 'normalization' of surviving mature vasculature, stabilizes vessels and prevents leakage. Its molecular weight is 149 kDa and its estimated terminal half-life is approximately 20 days for both men and women. The effectiveness and safety of bevacizumab was proven in retrospective and prospective controlled clinical trials for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion and retinopathy of prematurity, especially for zone I. Uncontrolled trials have shown its effectiveness in various other conditions as myopic and uveitic choroidal neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma. There are no absolute contraindications to intravitreal injection though it is recommended to withhold treatment in patients who have recently suffered from a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event and during pregnancy. Ocular complications from intravitreal use are usually mild and transient (corneal abrasion, chemosis, subconjunctival hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage). Bacterial endophthalmitis is rare (about 0.1%). New or progressive subretinal hemorrhages, tears of the retinal pigment epithelium and an increased incidence of geographic atrophy have also been reported.\n"

      " Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to Myopia, Infection and Inflammation.\n",
      "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a significant cause of vision loss in all age groups. The most common cause of CNV is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, CNV can also occur as a secondary manifestation of various inherited and acquired conditions, including pathologic myopia, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, and various hereditary, traumatic or inflammatory disorders. Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography are useful tools in the diagnosis and evaluation of CNV. Treatment options are similar to those for CNV secondary to AMD, specifically anti-angiogenic therapy, but including laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy and surgery. Anti-angiogenic therapy has been associated with better visual outcomes than other treatment modalities and is now advocated as the first-line therapy for CNV secondary to myopia, infection and inflammation.\n",

      "Purpose. To assess the ability of optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) to show and analyze retinal vascular patterns and the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in retinal vascular diseases. Methods. Seven eyes of seven consecutive patients with retinal vascular diseases were examined. Two healthy subjects served as controls. All eyes were scanned with the SD-OCT XR Avanti (Optovue Inc, Fremont CA, USA). Split spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography algorithm was used to identify the blood flow within the tissue. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) with Spectralis HRA + OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH) were performed. Results. In healthy subjects OCT-A visualized major macular vessels and detailed capillary networks around the foveal avascular zone. Patients were affected with myopic CNV (2 eyes), age-related macular degeneration related (2), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) (2), and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) (1). OCT-A images provided distinct vascular patterns, distinguishing perfused and nonperfused areas in BRVO and BRAO and recognizing the presence, location, and size of CNV. Conclusions. OCT-A provides detailed images of retinal vascular plexuses and quantitative data of pathologic structures. Further studies are warranted to define the role of OCT-A in the assessment of retinovascular diseases, with respect to conventional FA and ICG-A.\n"

      "RESULTS: The occurrence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy (diffuse or focal) has been shown to increase with increasing ocular axial length. Only 27 eyes (28.1%) appeared intact. As myopia progression implies axial growth of the eye, it is associated with a more severe decrease in choroid, RPE, and photoreceptor layer thicknesses: the longer the anterior-posterior axis, the thinner the above mentioned fundus structures. Age-related changes in the fundus are also likely to be more pronounced in longer axes. Myopic traction maculopathy, which in our case appeared the main cause of increased retinal thickness, was diagnosed in 105 eyes, \"outer\" macular retinoschisis--in 40 eyes.\n",

      "The body of knowledge of in vivo investigation of the choroid has been markedly enhanced by recent technological advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT). New insights elucidating the morphological features of the choriocapillaris and choroidal vasculature, in both physiological and pathological conditions, indicate that the choroid plays a pivotal role in many posterior segment diseases. In this article, a review of the histological characteristics of the choroid, which must be considered for the proper interpretation of in vivo imaging, is followed by a comprehensive discussion of fundamental principles of the current state-of-the-art in OCT, including cross-sectional OCT, en face OCT, and OCT angiography using both spectral domain OCT and swept source OCT technologies. A detailed review of the tomographic features of the choroid in the normal eye is followed by relevant findings in prevalent chorioretinal diseases, focusing on major causes of vision loss such as typical early and advanced age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, pachychoroid spectrum disorders, diabetic choroidopathy, and myopia.\n",

      "METHODS: The population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals aged 50+ years. The DFD was measured on fundus photographs.\n",
      "RESULTS: Readable fundus photographs were available for 2836 (81.8%) individuals. Mean DFD was 4.76 ± 0.34 mm (median: 4.74 mm; range: 3.76-6.53 mm). In multivariate analysis, longer DFD was associated with longer axial length (P<0.001; standardized correlation coefficient beta: 0.62), higher prevalence of axially high myopia (P<0.001; beta:0.06), shallower anterior chamber depth (P<0.001; beta:-0.18), thinner lens thickness (P = 0.004; beta: -0.06), smaller optic disc-fovea angle (P = 0.02; beta: -0.04), larger parapapillary alpha zone (P = 0.008; beta: 0.05), larger parapapillary beta/gamma zone (P<0.001; beta: 0.11), larger optic disc area (P<0.001; beta: 0.08), lower degree of cortical cataract (P = 0.002; beta: -0.08), and lower prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (P = 0.001; beta: -0.06). Bruch´s membrane opening-fovea distance (DFD minus disc radius minus parapapillary beta/gamma zone width) in non-glaucomatous eyes was not significantly (P = 0.60) related with axial length in emmetropic or axially myopic eyes (axial length ≥23.5 mm), while it increased significantly (P<0.001; r: 0.32) with longer axial length in eyes with an axial length of <23.5 mm. Ratio of mean DFD to disc diameter was 2.65 ± 0.30. If the ratio of disc-fovea distance to disc diameter was considered constant and if the individual disc diameter was calculated as the individual disc-fovea distance divided by the constant factor of 2.65, the resulting calculated disc diameter differed from the directly measured disc diameter by 0.16 ±0.13 mm (median: 0.13 mm, range: 0.00-0.89 mm) or 8.9 ± 7.3% (median: 7.4%; range: 0.00-70%) of the measured disc diameter.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: DFD (mean: 4.76 mm) increases with longer axial length, larger parapapillary alpha zone and parapapillary beta/gamma zone, and larger disc area. The axial elongation associated increase in DFD was due to an enlargement of parapapillary beta/gamma zone while the Bruch's membrane opening-fovea distance did not enlarge with longer axial length. This finding may be of interest for the process of emmetropization and myopization. Due to its variability, the disc-fovea distance has only limited clinical value as a relative size unit for structures at the posterior pole.\n"

      "Ophthalmic diseases include both those analogous to systemic diseases (eg, inflammation, infection, neuronal degeneration) and not analogous (eg, cataract, myopia). Many anterior segment diseases are treated pharmacologically through eye drops, which have an implied therapeutic index of local therapy. Unlike oral dosage forms administered for systemic diseases, eyedrops require patients not only to adhere to treatment, but to be able to accurately perform-ie, instill drops correctly. Anatomical and physiological barriers make topical delivery to the anterior chamber challenging-in some cases more challenging than absorption through the skin, nasal passages, or gut. Treatment of the posterior segment (eg, vitreous, retina, choroid, and optic nerve) is more challenging due to additional barriers. Recently, intravitreal injections have become a standard of care with biologics for the treatment of macular degeneration and other diseases. Although the eye has esterases, hydroxylases, and transporters, it has relatively little CYP450 enzymes. Because it is challenging to obtain drug concentrations at the target site, ocular clinical pharmacokinetics, and thus pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions, are rarely available. Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals require consideration of solubility, physiological pH, and osmolarity, as well as sterility and stability, which in turn requires optimal pharmaceutics. Although applied locally, ocular medications may be absorbed systemically, which results in morbidity and mortality (eg, systemic hypotension, bronchospasm, and bradycardia).\n"

      "Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, injected intravitreally, became a standard therapy for choroidal neovascularization in a course of wet age-related macular degeneration and degenerative myopia. Endophthalmitis is a very rare but the most serious complication associated with this procedure. The purpose of this paper is to present three patients with endophthalmitis following intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents. In the analysed material, the authors confirmed endophthalmitis in 2 of 4176 patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration and choroidal neovascularization associated with degenerative myopia (0.048%). The third reported case is a patient with endophthalmitis following the injection of bevacizumab performed in another center. The time interval between the injection and the onset of endophthalmitis was 2-5 days. In two patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy--one patient regained best corrected visual acuity, while another showed no improvement and developed eye atrophy. In one case the microbiological examination showed a growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, while in another a negative culture result was present. Endopthalmitis is a rare complication following the intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents. The proper selection of therapy depends on presenting best corrected visual acuity and severity of intraocular inflammation. The time of commencing treatment is a crucial prognostic factor, however, our observations showed that prompt and repeated surgical procedures cannot prevent irreversible vision loss in all cases.\n"

      "METHODS: 20 myopic subjects (\n",
      "RESULTS: For low myopic eyes, the IOL was measured at 24.619 ± 0.016 mm. The CT (273.85 ± 49.01 µm) was greatest under fovea as is in the case of healthy eyes. Peripheral to the fovea, the mean CT decreased rapidly along the nasal direction, reaching a minimum of 180.65 ± 58.25 µm at 5 mm away from the fovea. There was less of a change in thickness from the fovea in the temporal direction reaching a minimum of 234.25 ± 42.27 µm. In contrast to the low myopic eyes, for moderate and high myopic eyes, CTs were thickest in temporal region (where CT = 194.94 ± 27.28 and 163 ± 34.89 µm, respectively).

      "In clinical practice, maculopathy and neurological eye disorders often cause visual field defects. Once the defects are formed, treatment and rehabilitation are confronted with the bottleneck due to irreversibility. With the transformation of medical patterns and people's higher needs for rehabilitation, new approaches to visual training for these diseases with visual field defects are emerging. Currently, visual rehabilitation training for patients with visual field defects focuses on two directions: central visual field defects and hemianopia / peripheral visual field defects. Patients' fine vision is mainly affected by central visual field defects, the rehabilitation training for which can be divided into eccentric viewing training, eye movement training and perceptual learning training. Patients' visual exploration, orientation, walking and reading are largely influenced by hemianopia and peripheral visual field defects, the rehabilitation training for which can be separated into visual restoration strategy and eye movement compensatory strategy.\n",

      " Effect of Factor XIII-A G185T Polymorphism on Visual Prognosis after Photodynamic Therapy for Neovascular Macular Degeneration.\n",
      "Macular degenerations represent leading causes of central blindness or low vision in developed countries. Most of these severe visual disabilities are due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and pathologic myopia (PM), both of which are frequently complicated by subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V) is still employed for CNV treatment in selected cases or in combined regimen. In Caucasian patients, the common polymorphism G185T of factor XIII-A gene (FXIII-A-G185T; rs5985) has been described as predictor of poor angiographic CNV responsiveness to PDT-V. Nevertheless, the prognostic implications of this pharmacogenetic determinant on long-term visual outcome after a PDT-V regimen have not been evaluated. We retrospectively selected Caucasian patients presenting with treatment-naive CNV and receiving standardized PDT-V protocol for two years. The study population included patients affected by subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD or PM. We assessed the correlations between the polymorphic allele T of FXIII-A-G185T and: (1) total number of photodynamic treatments; and (2) change in visual acuity from baseline to the end of the follow-up period. Considering a total study population of 412 patients with neovascular AMD or PM, the carriers of 185 T-allele of FXIII-A (GT or TT genotype) received a higher number of photodynamic treatments than patients without it (GG wild-type genotype) (p < 0.01; mean number of PDT-V: 5.51 vs. 3.76, respectively). Moreover, patients with 185 T-allele of FXIII-A had a more marked worsening of visual acuity at 24 months than those with the GG-185 wild genotype (p < 0.01; mean difference in logMAR visual acuity: 0.22 vs. 0.08, respectively). The present findings show that the G185T polymorphism of the FXIII-A gene is associated with significant differences in the long-term therapeutic outcomes of patients treated with standardized PDT-V protocol. The comprehensive appraisal of both anti-thrombophilic effects due to FXIII-A G185T variant and photo-thrombotic action of PDT-V toward CNV provides several clues about the rationale of this intriguing pharmacogenetic correlation. Further investigations are warranted to outline the appropriate paradigm for guiding PDT-V utilization in the course of the combined therapeutic protocol for neovascular macular degeneration.\n"

      " Current and predicted demographics of high myopia and an update of its associated pathological changes.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Excessive axial elongation of the eye in high myopia can cause biomechanical stretching leading to various ocular complications. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on various pathologic changes, especially in the chorio-retina and sclera that have been reported recently using advanced ophthalmic bio-imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and fundus photography.\n",
      "RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence rates of pathologic myopia (myopic retinopathy and maculopathy) mirror the prevalence rates of high myopia as the risks of pathologic myopia increase with high myopia. Peripapillary and sub-foveal choroidal thinning, scleral thinning, and deformed/irregular eye shapes were found to be strongly associated with various pathologic myopic lesions, especially with posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy. Considering the increasing prevalence rate of myopia and pathologic myopia, these degenerative changes are likely to increase dramatically over the next few decades due to the rapid growth in the number of individuals with high myopia and the ageing population.\n",
      "SUMMARY: The current prevalence rates of pathologic myopia in older adults might have significantly underestimated the future prevalence rates and warrants age of onset of myopia being considered a major risk factor for pathologic myopia. Using advanced technology, identification of novel quantifiable chorio-retinal and scleral parameters in pathologic myopia would help to identify people at risk of developing pathologic myopia and potentially may revolutionise the management of myopia especially in risk prognostication and monitoring of disease progression.\n"

      "BACKGROUND/AIM: We have noted a phenotype of early-onset retinal dystrophy with macular staphyloma but without high myopia. The aim of this study is to report the underlying genetic mutations and the subcellular localisation of the gene product in the retina.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective case series (2012-2015); immunohistochemical analyses of mammalian retina for in situ protein localisation.\n",
      "RESULTS: All three probands were first noted to have decreased vision at 3-6 years old which worsened over time. At ages 39, 37 and 12 years old, all had similar retinal findings: dystrophic changes (retinal pigment epithelium mottling, vessel narrowing), macular staphyloma (despite only mild myopia or high hyperopia), and non-recordable electroretinography. All harboured homozygous mutations in C21orf2, a gene recently suggested to be associated with retinal dystrophy but of unknown function. Two had a frameshift deletion c.436_466del (p.Glu146Serfs*6). The third had a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Cys61Tyr) and was short (below the 3rd percentile) and obese (50th percentile for weight despite short stature). Immunohistochemical studies in human, pig and mouse retinas localised C21orf2 protein to the ciliary structures of the photoreceptor cell (the daughter basal body, the centriole adjacent to the basal body, and the connecting cilium).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This retinal dystrophy phenotype is caused by recessive mutations in C21orf2 and can be considered a retinal ciliopathy as C21orf2 encodes a protein that localises to photoreceptor ciliary structures. The short stature and obesity noted in the youngest girl suggest that for some patients biallelic C21orf2 mutations may result in syndromic ciliopathy.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: The rationale, objectives, study design and procedures for the longitudinal Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study are described.\n",
      "DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study was carried out.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Participants include surviving cohort from the rural component of Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study.\n",
      "METHODS: During 1996-2000, Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Survey was conducted in three rural (n = 7771) and one urban (n = 2522) areas (now called Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study 1). In 2009-2010, a feasibility exercise (Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study 2) for a longitudinal study (Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study 3) was undertaken in the rural clusters only, as urban clusters no longer existed. In Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study 3, a detailed interview will be carried out to collect data on sociodemographic factors, ocular and systemic history, risk factors, visual function, knowledge of eye diseases and barriers to accessing services. All participants will also undergo a comprehensive eye examination including photography of lens, optic disc and retina, Optic Coherence Tomography of the posterior segment, anthropometry, blood pressure and frailty measures.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures include estimates of the incidence of visual impairment and age-related eye disease (lens opacities, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration) and the progression of eye disease (lens opacities and myopia) and associated risk factors.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 7771 respondents examined in rural areas in Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study 1, 5447 (70.1%) participants were traced in Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study 2. These participants will be re-examined.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study 3 will provide data on the incidence and progression of visual impairment and major eye diseases and their associated risk factors in India. The study will provide further evidence to aid planning eye care services.\n"

      "Microperimetry-1 (MP-1) evaluation and MP-1 biofeedback training were done in a case of bilateral myopic macular degeneration with a central scotoma. Fixation behavior, location and stability of preferred retinal locus, eye movement speed, and mean sensitivity were assessed. The mean retinal sensitivities before, after and at 1-year after training in the right eye were 2.9 dB, 2.9 dB and 3.7 dB and in the left eye were 3.5 dB, 3.7 dB and 1.8 dB. The fixation point in the 2° gravitation circle, improved from 40% to 50% in the right eye and from 43% to 67% in the left eye. The average eye speed before, after and at 1-year after training in right eye were 0.19°/s, 0.26°/s and 0.25°/s and in left eye were 0.36°/s, 0.25°/s and 0.27°/s.

      "INTRODUCTION: Hypotony maculopathy is ocular hypotony complicated by papilledema and/or folding of the retina and choroid in the posterior pole. Our objective was to examine the current literature regarding hypotony maculopathy and treatment methods.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic review of the English-language literature was conducted by performing a broad search of PubMed from 1972 through 2015 using the keywords hypotony maculopathy and hypotony. Additional articles were identified from bibliographies of relevant articles.\n",
      "RESULTS: Hypotony maculopathy was infrequent before the introduction of antimetabolite agents in glaucoma-filtering surgery, and the incidence of this entity is now up to 20%. Risk factors for developing hypotony maculopathy include male gender, young age, myopia, and primary filtering surgery. Correctly identifying the etiology of hypotony is essential for successful treatment. Treatment of hypotony maculopathy includes procedures to elevate the intraocular pressure, thus reversing the collapse of the scleral wall and chorioretinal wrinkling.\n",

      " Postoperative anatomical and functional outcomes of different stages of high myopia macular hole.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recently it was suggested that high myopia macular holes (HMMH) and macular holes accompanied by retinal detachment occur in the advanced stages of myopia traction maculopathy (MTM), while macular retinoschisis, shallow retinal detachment without holes, and lamellar macular holes occur in the early stages of MTM. Complete vitreous cortex removal associated with internal limiting membrane peeling is now widely used to treat HMMH. However, it remains uncertain at what HMMH stage patients would benefit most from surgical intervention. Our study was aimed to evaluate the postoperative anatomical changes and functional outcomes of high myopia macular holes (HMMH).\n",
      "METHODS: Patients were retrospectively collected between March 2009 and August 2011. Before and 1st, 3rd, and 9th month after 23G pars plana vitrectomy, all patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and MP-1. At each follow-up, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), photoreceptor inner and outer segments (IS/OS) defects, and retinal sensitivity (RS) were investigated. According to different preoperative macular hole morphologies, patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, macular hole with epiretinal membrane (ERM) traction and macular retinoschisis; Group 2, full-thickness macular hole (FTMH); Group 3, FTMH with subretinal fluid.\n",
      "RESULTS: 43 eyes from 43 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60 years. BCVA and RS were significantly improved after vitrectomy; the mean IS/OS defect was significantly reduced. At 9 postoperative months, 11 of 43 (25.6 %) eyes achieved IS/OS junction integrity; 9 of these 11 (81.8 %) eyes belonged to Group 1, 2 (18.2 %) belonged to Group 2.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy combined with ILM peeling and gas tamponade results in limited functional outcomes in patients with HMMH. The appearance of subretinal fluid indicates a worse prognosis for surgical intervention.\n"

      " Analysis of Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors and Their Interactions in Korean Patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the association of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions in Korean patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 314 robustly characterized exudative AMD patients, including 111 PCV (polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy) and 154 typical choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and 395 control subjects without any evidence of AMD were enrolled. Full ophthalmologic examinations including fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were done, according to which patients were divided into either PCV or typical CNV. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information regarding underlying systemic diseases, dietary habits, smoking history and body mass index (BMI). A total of 86 SNPs from 31 candidate genes were analyzed. Genotype association and logistic regression analyses were done and stepwise regression models to best predict disease for each AMD subtype were constructed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Age, spherical equivalent, myopia, and ever smoking were associated with exudative AMD. Age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, spherical equivalent, and myopia were risk factors for typical CNV, while increased education and ever smoking were significantly associated with PCV (p<.05 for all). Four SNPs, ARMS2/HTRA1 rs10490924, rs11200638, and rs2736911, and CFH rs800292, showed association with exudative AMD. Two of these SNPs, ARMS2/HTRA1 rs10490924 and rs11200638, showed significant association with typical CNV and PCV specifically. There were no significant interactions between environmental and genetic factors. The most predictive disease model for exudative AMD included age, spherical equivalent, smoking, CFH rs800292, and ARMS2 rs10490924 while that for typical CNV included age, hyperlipidemia, spherical equivalent, and ARMS2 rs10490924. Smoking, spherical equivalent, and ARMS2 rs10490924 were the most predictive variables for PCV. When comparing PCV cases to CNV cases, age, BMI, and education were the most predictive risk factors of PCV.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Only one locus, the ARMS2/HTRA1 was a significant genetic risk factor for Korean exudative AMD, including its subtypes, PCV and typical CNV. Stepwise regression revealed that CFH was important to risk of exudative AMD in general but not to any specific subtype. While increased education was a unique risk factor to PCV when compared to CNV, this association was independent of refractive error in this homogenous population from South Korea. No significant interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors were observed.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of scleral hyaline plaque among older adults in the city of Niterói in southeastern Brazil. A second goal was to assess the correlation between scleral hyaline plaque and several age-related diseases, including eye diseases and systemic diseases.\n",
      "METHODS: The study sample comprised 667 participants who were followed for 15 months. The study had a prospective, longitudinal, observational design that established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The following variables were selected for correlation with scleral hyaline plaque: sex, age, age range, iris color, ethnicity, presence of cataract, moderate to high myopia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, degenerative arthritis, and osteoporosis. These correlations were assessed by means of the χ (2) test and Student's t-test. Multivariate analysis was performed to exclude factors that were potentially associated with aging exclusively but that did not have a direct relationship with hyaline plaque. Binary logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios, significance, and confidence intervals.\n",
      "RESULTS: Scleral hyaline plaques were found in 177 patients (17.54%). There was a statistically significant association between the presence of hyaline plaques and sex (female), age range (≥70 years old), ethnicity (Caucasian), cataract, moderate to high myopia, systemic arterial hypertension, degenerative arthritis, and osteoporosis (P<0.05). On multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, only female sex, age range (≥70 years), moderate to high myopia, and degenerative arthritis exhibited significant correlation.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The prevalence of scleral hyaline plaque in the present study was higher than in previous reports in the medical literature. Several age-related diseases exhibited a correlation with scleral hyaline plaque. The most significant factors associated with scleral hyaline plaque were advanced age, female sex, moderate to high myopia, and degenerative arthritis.\n"

We measured PPCT by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with a 3.4-mm scan circle centered on the optic nerve head.\n",
      "RESULTS: Peripapillary choroidal thickness measurements were available for 3060 (88.2%) study participants with a mean age of 64.4 ± 9.6 years (range, 50-93 years). Mean global PPCT was 134 ± 53 μm (range, 35-348 μm). Peripapillary choroid was thickest in the superior region (155 ± 60 μm), followed by the temporal region (144 ± 75 μm; P < 0.001); nasal region (139 ± 55 μm; P < 0.001); and inferior region (110 ± 45 μm; P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, thicker PPCT was associated with younger age (P < 0.001; standardized coefficient β: -0.33; correlation coefficient B: -1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.25, -1.65); shorter axial length (P < 0.001; β: -0.11; B: -5.39; 95% CI: -7.85, -2.93); smaller parapapillary α zone (P = 0.01; β: -0.06; B: -5.46; 95% CI: -9.73, -1.19); and smaller β zone (P < 0.001; β: -0.14; B: -8.29; 95% CI: -11.12, -5.46); better best corrected visual acuity (logMAR; P = 0.002; β: -0.05; B: -14.75; 95% CI: -28.59, -0.91), and higher prevalence of early age-related macular degeneration (P = 0.04; β: 0.05; B: 9.11; 95% CI: 0.42, 17.80) and intermediate age-related macular degeneration (P = 0.001; β: 0.08; B: 10.90; 95% CI: 4.46, 17.33). It was not significantly (all P > 0.05) associated with blood pressure, blood concentration of lipids, intraocular pressure and prevalence of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusions. The decrease of PPCT with longer axial length occurred predominantly in the temporal region.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Peripapillary choroidal thickness is thickest superiorly and thinnest inferiorly. It decreases by 2 μm per year of life and by 5 μm per diopter of myopia. Thinner PPCT is correlated with larger parapapillary α and β zones. The association of thinner PPCT with lower best corrected visual acuity may warrant further study.\n"

      "AIM: To study the frequency of patients with macular pathology being wrongly diagnosed with cataract and possible reasons for this to occur.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1390 patients (1390 eyes), in whom cataract turned out to be not the main cause of visual impairment, were recruited as research subjects. To reveal the reasons for misdiagnosis, we resorted to methods of ophthalmic examination that are available at ambulatory care facilities, i.e. visual acuity measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior and posterior eye segments, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy.\n",
      "RESULTS: In most patients (72.6%) visual acuity was decreased due to macular pathology, especially age-related macular degeneration (AMD)--736 eyes (72.9%). Less common were degenerative myopia (10%), idiopathic macular hole (8.4%), epiretinal macular fibrosis (5.1%), and secondary macular changes of vascular, traumatic, or inflammatory genesis (3.6%). In 76.6% of eyes with macular pathology ophthalmoscopy was perfectly feasible and could be performed by a local ophthalmologist. Only in 23.4% of cases there was a dense posterior capsule opacification or nuclear cataract that impeded visualization of macular structures.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The main reason for misdiagnosis of macular pathology and referring the patient to cataract surgeon was the neglect of apparent discordance between visual acuity and lens transparency. One should aim at adequate assessment of macular zone by all means, including non-contact ophthalmoscopy with 60 or 90 D aspherical lenses or Hruby lens and red-free examination.\n"

      " INDICATIONS AND RESULTS OF A NEW L-SHAPED MACULAR BUCKLE TO SUPPORT A POSTERIOR STAPHYLOMA IN HIGH MYOPIA.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of a macular buckle in treating myopic traction maculopathy was studied.\n",
      "METHODS: Fifty eyes with myopic traction maculopathy, in the form of macular detachment with macular hole (MHMD), or without macular hole (MD) and macular foveoschisis (MF), were treated with vitrectomy combined with macular buckle or with a macular buckle without vitrectomy.\n",
      "RESULTS: Combined group: The combined group comprised 10 eyes with MHMD, 6 eyes with MD, and 4 eyes with MF. The retina was attached in 100% of MD and MHMD and the MF was improved in 100% of cases. The hole was closed in 60% of MHMD. The mean initial and final Snellen best-corrected visual acuity was 20/500 and 20/100 for MHMD, 20/200 and 20/60 for MD, and 20/200 and 20/50 for MF. The mean surgical time was 80 ± 35 minutes. Fundus angiography or indocyanine green revealed no alteration of the chorioretinal blood flow. Buckle shortening was required in 6/20 (30% of cases) patients for lateral extrusion of the sponge through the conjunctiva with the first sponge model. This complication was overcome by changing the arm of the buckle. Buckle group: The buckle group comprised 5 eyes with MHMD, 11 with MD, and 14 with MF. The retina was attached in 100% of MHMD, MD, and MF. The macular hole was closed in 60%. The mean initial and final Snellen best-corrected visual acuity was 20/800 and 20/60 for MHMD, 20/125 and 20/50 for MD, and 20/200 and 20/63 for MF. The mean postoperative decrement in axial length was 1.21 mm. The mean surgical time was 35 ± 15 minutes. Fundus angiography or indocyanine green revealed no alteration of the chorioretinal blood flow. Complications included conjunctiva erosion (15%), diplopia (7.7%), and pain (3.8%). Magnetic resonance imaging showed flattening of the posterior staphyloma.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Considering the possible complications and technical difficulties of vitrectomy, we suggest that the macular buckle alone should be the first treatment of myopic traction maculopathy. Vitrectomy should be reserved only for cases of tangential tractions.\n",

      " Jugular Vein Insufficiency and Choroidal Neovascularization in Moderate Myopia: A New Unknown Factor of Additional Risk?\n",
      "To date, choroidal blood flow reduction in highly myopic eyes appears to be related to the development of choroidal neovascularization secondary to local reduction of arterial flow. Instead, no evidence of choroidal neovascularization was found in subjects with low or moderate myopia. The authors' aim has been to encourage new studies regarding the potential role of chronic retinal venous congestion in the pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularization. In December 2011, a 54-year-old woman with moderate bilateral myopia had a sudden block upon swallowing while she was eating. Subsequently (January 2013) metamorphopsia in the left eye revealed macular degeneration with choroidal neovascularization. The related echo-color Doppler study of the neck veins, performed in November 2014, showed an atypical left jugular insufficiency associated with homolateral hypertension of the superior ophthalmic veins. This singular case highlights the necessity to further investigate the potential role of chronic alterations of intra- and extracranial venous drainage in the disruption of choroidal flow in myopic patients.\n"

      " Peripherin mutations cause a distinct form of recessive Leber congenital amaurosis and dominant phenotypes in asymptomatic parents heterozygous for the mutation.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Dominant mutations in peripherin (PRPH2) are associated with a spectrum of retinal dystrophy phenotypes, many of which are adult onset and involve the macula. Recessive PRPH2 mutations cause retinal dystrophy associated with prominent maculopathy in adulthood; however, the presenting childhood phenotype has not been defined. We characterise this phenotype.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective case series of families harbouring bi-allelic PRPH2 mutations (2010-2014).\n",
      "RESULTS: Three children (two families; assessed at 2 years old) and two adults (one family; assessed at 24 and 35 years old) with homozygous PRPH2 mutations (c.497G>A (p.Cys166Tyr) or c.136C>T (p.Arg46*)) all had infantile nystagmus and decreased vision noted soon after birth and a history of staring at lights during infancy (photophilia). The three children had high hyperopia, a normal or near normal fundus, and non-recordable electroretinographies (ERGs). The two adults had slight myopia, macular and peripheral retinal changes, and non-recordable ERGs. All five available carrier parents had macular±peripheral retinal findings, although they considered themselves asymptomatic except for one mother who had developed visual loss in one eye at 48 years old and had an associated subfoveal lesion.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Bi-allelic PRPH2 mutations cause a distinct Leber congenital amaurosis phenotype in infancy; affected adults have prominent maculopathy. Heterozygous parents can be asymptomatic but have clinically obvious macular phenotypes with or without peripheral retinal findings, which can be helpful in making the genetic diagnosis in affected children. The difference between the heterozygous and homozygous phenotypes is likely related to gene product dosage effect.\n"

      " Vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane peeling for macular folds secondary to hypotony in myopes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Hypotony maculopathy (HM) changes may persist, and visual acuity remains poor, despite normalization of intraocular pressure (IOP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the visual and anatomical results of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, and 20% SF6 gas tamponade in five myopic patients with HM.\n",
      "METHODS: This retrospective interventional study was conducted at the Barraquer Center of Ophthalmology, a tertiary care center in Barcelona, Spain, and included five eyes from five consecutive patients (aged 55.4±13.1 years) with HM caused by different conditions. All the patients were treated with 23-gauge PPV, ILM peeling, and 20% SF6 gas tamponade. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation was performed using anterior and posterior biomicroscopy and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by logMAR charts.\n",
      "RESULTS: Before surgery, median spherical equivalent was -13.1 (range -7, -19) diopters of myopia. Preoperatively, four cases presented IOP <6.5 mmHg for 3 (range 2-8) weeks. In three of these four cases, IOP >6.5 mmHg was achieved over 16 (range 16-28) weeks, without resolution of HM; increased IOP was not achieved in the remaining case treated 2 weeks after diagnosis of HM. One case presented IOP >6.5 mmHg with HM for 28 weeks before surgery. Preoperative BCVA was 0.7 (range 0.26-2.3) logMAR, and 0.6 (range 0.3-0.7) logMAR and 0.5 (range 0.2-1) logMAR, respectively, at 4 and 12 months after surgery. There was no statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative BCVA. Hyper-pigmentation lines in the macular area were observed in three cases with hypotony. These lines progressed after surgery despite resolution of the retinal folds in the three cases, and BCVA decreased in parallel in two of these cases.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: PPV with ILM peeling followed by gas tamponade is a good alternative for the treatment of HM in myopic patients. However, persistent choroidal folds may compromise BCVA. We therefore recommend initiating treatment as early as possible.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To study the current prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in an adult Chinese population.\n",
      "DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: We used a random cluster sampling method and evaluated 10 234 eligible subjects ≥45 years old (response rate, 78.1%) in the Taizhou Eye Study.\n",
      "METHODS: Examinations were performed from July 2012 through December 2013. Participants underwent a detailed examination, including uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure, axial length, slit-lamp, and fundus examinations to evaluate the prevalence and primary causes of visual impairment (VI).\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We defined low vision and blindness according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (low vision: BCVA, <20/63-≥20/400; blindness: BCVA, <20/400 in the better eye) and United States criteria (low vision: BCVA, <20/40-≥20/200; blindness: BCVA, <20/200 in the better eye).\n",
      "RESULTS: Using the WHO BCVA criteria, the standardized prevalence of bilateral low vision and blindness were 5.1% and 1.0%, respectively. Using the United States BCVA criteria, the standardized prevalence were 12.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Using the WHO criteria, the primary causes of bilateral low vision and blindness were cataract (59.1% and 48.5%, respectively), myopic macular degeneration (17.6% and 17.2%, respectively), and age-related macular degeneration (11.6% and 10.1%, respectively). The primary causes of monocular low vision were cataract (55.6%), age-related macular degeneration (12.6%), and myopic macular degeneration (8.9%), whereas those of monocular blindness were cataract (46.8%), atrophy of eyeball or prosthetic eye (10.2%), and cornea opacity (7.3%). A further analysis revealed that in adults 45-59 years old, myopic macular degeneration (59.6% and 27.2%, respectively) and cataract (13.8% and 23.4%, respectively) were the leading causes of bilateral and monocular VI. In adults ≥60 years old, cataract (66.8% and 61.2%, respectively) and age-related macular degeneration (12.6% and 11.8%, respectively) were the primary causes of bilateral and monocular VI.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of low vision and blindness in Chinese adults remains a severe public health problem. In the Taizhou Eye Study, cataract was the leading cause of low vision and blindness. Myopic macular degeneration and cataract were the primary causes of VI in adults 45-59 years and ≥60 years old, respectively.\n"

      " Foveal and Macular Thickness Evaluation by Spectral OCT SLO and Its Relation with Axial Length in Various Degree of Myopia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the foveal and macular thickness in various degrees of myopia and its association with axial length in low, moderate and high degrees of myopia.\n",
      "DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was done in the Department of Ophthalmology, MGMCRI, Pondicherry, India.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty five eyes eyes of 64 myopic subjects between the age group of 20-40 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected and complete ophthalmic examination was done. Cycloplegic refraction was done and the subjects were categorized into low (n=43 eyes), moderate (n=43 eyes) and high (n=36) degrees of myopia. The foveal and macular thickness was assessed using spectral OCT- SLO and axial length was measured by A-scan biometry.\n",
      "RESULTS: The foveae minimum of high myopia (178 ± 26.4 microns) was significantly thicker compared to moderate myopia (p= 0.028). There was no significant intergroup difference in the thickness significance of the outer and inner macular between mild, moderate and high degree of myopia. The mean axial length of high myopia (26.7±0.97mm) was significantly higher compared to moderate (24.6±0.81mm) and low myopia (23.5±0.81mm) with a p-value of p = 0.001. There was a positive correlation of axial length with foveae minimum, fovea and superior inner macula in respect to myopia (p<0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The foveal and macular thickness in myopia is influenced by the axial length. Early detection of such changes in macular thickness by using OCT is helpful in understanding the mechanism and factors affecting the structural changes of myopic eyes. Also it implicates the importance of refractive error induced retinal macular changes while interpreting OCT.\n"

      " LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF 23-GAUGE PARS PLANA VITRECTOMY WITH INTERNAL LIMITING MEMBRANE PEELING AND GAS TAMPONADE FOR MYOPIC TRACTION MACULOPATHY: A Prospective Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of microincisional 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and gas tamponade in the treatment of myopic traction maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: A prospective nonrandomized multicenter study was designed. Patients with myopic traction maculopathy without macular hole and retinal detachment were included in the study between January 2009 and May 2012. All patients underwent microincisional 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with ILM peeling and 12% C3F8 gas tamponade. In all cases, brilliant blue G staining of the ILM was performed. All patients were prospectively evaluated. The evolution of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular thickness were recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: Myopic traction maculopathy resolved in 28 of the 30 patients (93%) included. Mean follow-up was 33.8 ± 13 months (range, 24-60 months). Mean time of myopic traction maculopathy resolution after surgery was 2.65 ± 1.4 months. At 1 month after surgery, one patient developed a macular hole and another one a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. After 2 years, another patient developed a retinal detachment. Statistically significant improvements in macular thickness compared with baseline were found at all follow-up visits (P < 0.001, Student's t-test). At final visit, BCVA improved significantly compared with baseline (P = 0.044, Wilcoxon's test). However, a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity was achieved only in eyes with a preoperative Snellen visual acuity ≥ 20/63 (P = 0.027). In contrast, the final BCVA of eyes with worse preoperative visual acuity (<20/63) did not improve significantly (P = 0.41, Wilcoxon's test).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Microincisional 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with ILM peeling and gas tamponade is effective in the treatment of myopic traction maculopathy, with low postoperative complications. Globally, both BCVA and macular thickness improved significantly during the follow-up period. However, greater visual acuity improvements were only seen in eyes with preoperative BCVA equal to or better than 20/63 Snellen equivalent. Some concerns remain about the risk of macular hole formation after ILM peeling. Further studies are necessary to investigate this issue.\n"

      " Anti-VEGF therapies in the treatment of choroidal neovascularisation secondary to non-age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration.\n",
      "DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases and conference abstracts were searched (from inception to Jan 2014).\n",
      "STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Randomised and non-randomised comparative studies with follow-up of at least 6 months were included and were used to assess clinical effectiveness.\n",
      "STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHOD: Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological heterogeneity.\n",
      "RESULTS: 16 studies met the inclusion criteria (1091 eyes; 963 pathological myopia, 74 other conditions). There was large variation in risk of bias across studies. An improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in anti-VEGF arms over comparators was reported in all studies. The proportion of patients improving by at least 15 letters in anti-VEGF arms ranged from 27.3% to 70%. There were no significant differences between bevacizumab and ranibizumab.\n",
      "LIMITATIONS: Owing to the rarity of choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration or pathological myopia, there are unlikely to ever be sufficiently powered trials in these populations.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab and ranibizumab appear to be effective in improving visual acuity for patients with choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration. The evidence base is strongest for choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia, however, based on current evidence and likely pharmacological pathways, clinicians should consider treatment with either bevacizumab or ranibizumab for rarer causes.\n"

      " The other CNVM: a review of myopic choroidal neovascularization treatment in the age of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents.\n",
      "Choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) associated with pathological myopia (PM) can result in significant vision loss and legal blindness. These membranes usually occur subfoveally and are a major complication of PM, developing in approximately 5-10% of such eyes. PM is the second most common cause of choroidal neovascularization after age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and accounts for nearly 60% of CNVM cases in patients younger than age 50. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A has been implicated as the major angiogenic stimulus responsible for choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD and several major studies have proved the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment for AMD-related CNVM. Benefits have also been observed in a number of prospective and retrospective studies evaluating PM CNVM. Despite the small differences in molecular properties of ranibizumab and bevacizumab, both drugs showed similar therapeutic effects for CNVM associated with PM. Many studies also highlighted that patient age, previous photodynamic therapy treatment, axial length, and visual acuity prior to treatment may affect treatment prognosis. Although there is a paucity of large randomized controlled trials, this systematic review highlights the large numbers of individual trials that demonstrate a significant improvement in VA. The inferior long-term results of alternative therapies, combined with an excellent safety profile from anti-VEGF treatment, make anti-VEGF the current recommended first-line therapy.\n"

The purpose of this study was to characterize the traits of patients presenting at a low vision clinic in China.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of the records of 299 patients who visited the Low Vision Clinic of Eye and ENT Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University from January 2009 to May 2014. Reviewed parameters included age, gender, education, occupation, cause of visual impairment and types of low vision aids (LVAs) dispensed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of all the patients (193 male; aged from 3 to 96 years, with a mean of 29.74 ± 25.23 years), 43.48% experienced moderate visual impairment, 25.42% had severe visual impairment and 21.07% were blind. The four major causes of visual impairment were congenital cataract (14.38%), degenerative myopia (13.71%), juvenile macular degeneration (9.36%) and retinitis pigmentosa (9.36%). The most common causes of visual impairment were congenital cataract (22.67%) in 0-19-year-olds, retinitis pigmentosa (20.62%) in 20-59-year-olds, and age-related macular degeneration (36.54%) in the 60+ group. With the help of LVAs, a significant improvement of distance and/or near vision or visual field was observed in 243 patients, of whom 185 accepted LVAs and 58 patients refused due to high price, inconvenience, young age (≤ 6 y), clumsy appearance and ignorance. The most commonly dispensed LVAs were stand magnifiers (21.57%) followed by spectacle-type LVAs (19.21%).\n",

Patients who self-reported their ethnic origin either as European Caucasian (EC) or South Asian (SA) were included. Exclusion criteria included trauma, previous vitreoretinal procedures, age under 18 years, complicated cataract surgery and the presence of syndromes known to be associated with a high prevalence of RD. Detailed phenotypic data were collected. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were undertaken.\n",

      "Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of permanent visual loss in the elderly. Advancing age, as the name suggests, is a major risk factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor. (VEGF) along with other factors could be responsible for the dramatic damage in the eyes. Although uncommon in pre-senile group, this disorder can also occur unrelated to age, such as pathologic myopia in which Fuch's spots can classically be seen. It can also occur following traumatic disruption of the Bruch's membrane. Herein we report a case of a 20-year-old healthy female with no known co-morbidities who presented with complaints of sudden central visual loss in her left eye over the course of a few days (one week) with no preceding history of traumatic event or predisposing factor.

In parallel with the increased prevalence of myopia, are increases in associated blinding ocular conditions including glaucoma, retinal detachment and macular degeneration, making myopia a significant global health concern. The elongation of the eye is closely related to the biomechanical properties of the sclera, which in turn are largely dependent on the composition of the scleral extracellular matrix. Therefore an understanding of the cellular and extracellular events involved in the regulation of scleral growth and remodeling during childhood and young adulthood will provide future avenues for the treatment of myopia and its associated ocular complications.\n"

      " Spontaneous bilateral retinal pigment epithelium rips with good visual acuity.\n",
      "Retinalpigment epithelium (RPE) rips commonly occur in retinochoroidal disorders including age-related macular degeneration, idiopathic polypoid alchoroidal vasculopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, high myopia andchoroidal neovascularization. Most patients have unilateral involvement and poor visual prognosis. A 55-year-old female presented with decreased vision in her right eye for one week. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 6/12 in the right eye and 6/6-2 in the left. Fundus examination revealed a large juxtafoveal RPE rip in the right eye and multiple small pigment epithelium detachments in the left. No abnormal hyperfluorescent lesions were detected byfundus angiography. High-doseoral antioxidant was prescribed. A pigment epithelium detachment (PED) in the left eye grew larger over the follow-up period. Ultimately, a RPE rip also occurred in the left eye in the 17th week offollow-up. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 6/9. Although reinvestigation was done, no other choroidal abnormalities were demonstrated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus angiography. During the observation, RPE tears were reattached spontaneously in both eyes. A considerable amount of RPE proliferation, migration, and repopulation was also demonstrated by OCT and fundus autofluorescence. After 2.5 years of follow-ups, her best-corrected visual acuity was 6/9 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left. We hypothesize that the increased surface tension of RPE is the etiology of RPE rips in this case. Furthermore, the underlying chorioretinal abnormality directly affects the visual prognosis and further studies are needed in prevention, pathogenesis and treatment.\n"

      " The Prevalence of Age-Related Eye Diseases and Cataract Surgery among Older Adults in the City of Lodz, Poland.\n",
      "Purpose. To determine the prevalence of age-related eye diseases and cataract surgery among older adults in the city of Lodz, in central Poland. Material and Methods. The study design was cross-sectional and observational study. A total of 1107 women and men of predominantly Caucasian origin were successfully enumerated and recruited for the study. All selected subjects were interviewed and underwent detailed ophthalmic examinations. Results. Overall 8.04% (95% CI 6.44-9.64) subjects had cataract surgery in either eye. After excluding subjects with bilateral cataract surgery, the prevalence of cataract was 12.10% (95% CI 10.18-14.03). AMD was found in 4.33% (95% CI 3.14-5.54 ) of all subjects. Of them 3.25% (95% CI 2.21-4.30 ) had early AMD and 1.08% (95% CI 0.47-1.69) had late AMD. Various types of glaucoma were diagnosed in 5.51% (95% CI 4.17-6.85) of subjects and 2.62% (95% CI 1.68-3.56) had OHT. The prevalence rates of DR and myopic macular degeneration were 1.72% (95% CI 0.95-2.48) and 0.45% (95% CI 0.06-0.85), respectively. All multiple logistic regression models were only significantly associated with older age. The highest rate of visual impairment was observed among subjects with retinal diseases. Conclusions. The study revealed high prevalence of age-related eye diseases in this older population.\n"

      " Lack of Interphotoreceptor Retinoid Binding Protein Caused by Homozygous Mutation of RBP3 Is Associated With High Myopia and Retinal Dystrophy.\n",
      "PURPOSE: We present a detailed clinical and molecular study of four patients from two consanguineous families with a similar childhood-onset retinal dystrophy resulting from novel homozygous nonsense mutations in RBP3.\n",
      "METHODS: Four children with mutations in RBP3 encoding interphotoreceptor binding protein (IRBP) were ascertained by whole exome sequencing and subsequent direct Sanger sequencing. Detailed phenotyping was performed, including full clinical evaluation, electroretinography, fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n",
      "RESULTS: Two novel homozygous nonsense mutations (c.1530T>A;p.Y510* and c.3454G>T;p.E1152*) in RBP3 were identified in four patients from two families. All four patients had a similar, unusual retinal dystrophy characterized by childhood onset high myopia, generalized rod and cone dysfunction, and an unremarkable fundus appearance. The FAF imaging showed multiple paracentral foci of low autofluorescence in one patient and patchy increased FAF in the region of the vascular arcades in another. The OCT showed loss of outer retinal bands over peripheral macular areas in all 4 cases.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the retinal dystrophy in children caused by homozygous nonsense RBP3 mutations, highlighting the requirement for IRBP in normal eye development and visual function. Longitudinal study will reveal if the four children reported here will progress to a more typical retinitis pigmentosa phenotype described previously in adults with RBP3 mutations. The RBP3-related disease should be considered in children with high myopia and retinal dystrophy, particularly when there are no significant fundus changes.\n"

      "PURPOSE: We introduce a new method to observe the morphologic features of the vitreous with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) by evaluating and describing the posterior vitreous structure of various selected cases using enhanced high-density (HD) line mode.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a descriptive case series of SD-OCT images with enhanced HD line at Denver Health Medical Center, University of Colorado School of Medicine, in 2014. The medical records with ocular images for these patients were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Enhanced HD line in vitreoretinal mode with SD-OCT offered wide images with well-visible vitreoretinal interface. The posterior precortical vitreous pocket (PPVP), often mistaken as a posterior vitreous detachment on standard retina-based cross line mode, was easily identified. Vitreomacular adhesion and traction, absence or presence of connecting channels between PPVP and Cloquet's canal, liquefied vitreous lacuna, and emulsified silicone oil droplet-layer could be observed.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: SD-OCT using enhanced HD line in vitreoretinal mode enables clear visualization of the posterior vitreous structure and often reclassifies patients previously thought to have a posterior vitreous detachment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between the aqueous humour concentration of interleukin IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12p, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and axial length in eyes with cataract.\n",
      "METHODS: The hospital-based investigation included patients who underwent cataract surgery between March 2014 and April 2014. Using aqueous humour collected at the start of cataract surgery, the interleukins IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12p, TNF-α and VEGF were examined using a cytometric bead array. Axial length was determined by partial coherence laser interferometry (IOL Master).\n",
      "RESULTS: The study included 33 patients with cataract (33 eyes) with a mean age of 69.2±10.8 years (range: 50-87 years) and a mean axial length of 24.7±1.9 mm (range: 22.6-31.5 mm). Lower aqueous concentration of VEGF was significantly associated with longer axial length (VEGF concentration (pg/mL) = -5.12 x Axial Length (mm) + 163; correlation coefficient r = -0.41; P<0.001) and more myopic refractive error (VEGF concentration (pg/mL) = 1.27 x spherical equivalent (diopters) + 44.8; r = 0.383; P = 0.002). The aqueous concentrations of all other substances were not significantly (all P>0.10) associated with axial length or refractive error.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Higher intravitreal concentrations of VEGF were measured in eyes with a longer axial length, while the intraocular concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p and TNF-α were not correlated with axial length. The lower concentration of VEGF in axially elongated eyes may be one of the reasons for the lower prevalence of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy in myopic eyes.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To assess the treatment of pediatric patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) by scleral buckling with chandelier illumination.\n",
      "METHODS: Three eyes were treated in three patients, healthy boys aged 7 years, 12 years, and 11 years, with RRD, macular involvement, and small retinal holes, of which two were preoperatively undetectable. Conventional scleral buckling with cryoretinopexy was performed under the contact lens for vitreous surgery or noncontact wide-angle viewing system using 27-gauge twin chandelier illumination.\n",
      "RESULTS: The only known predisposing factor for retinal detachment was myopia stronger than 3 D with lattice retinal degeneration in two of the three patients. Retinal reattachment was achieved in all cases without intra- or postoperative complications. However, visual recovery was limited in one of the three patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Scleral buckling with chandelier illumination is effective for pediatric RRD, especially if the retinal hole is difficult to detect preoperatively. However, visual recovery was sometimes limited because of macular involvement due to late diagnosis, which is one of the characteristic features of pediatric RRD.\n",

      "PURPOSE: This study was initiated to investigate whether the presence of macular oedema influenced intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation in eyes with epiretinal membrane.\n",
      "METHODS: The files of patients undergoing combined phacoemulsification were retrospectively reviewed. Two groups were defined according to presence of macular oedema. The main outcome measure was the IOL power prediction error (PE). Secondary outcome measures were the correlation between preoperative macular thickness, absolute change of macular thickness and dioptric shift. The mean postoperative PE achieved with the Haigis formula was compared with the PE that would have been obtained had the SRKII and HofferQ formulas been used.\n",
      "RESULTS: We investigated 47 eyes of 47 consecutive patients. Regardless of the IOL formula used, the PE was on average higher in eyes without macula oedema (group 1). The myopic dioptric shift was dependent on preoperative macular thickness and absolute change of macular thickness. This association was more markedly pronounced in group 1.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Increased retinal thickness is the main cause for underestimation of the cornea-photoreceptor layer distance, and therefore could contribute to inaccuracy in IOL power calculations. The current results show that a myopic shift tends to be less pronounced in cases where a macula oedema is present. Eyes with pure traction have less predictable refractive results in terms of higher PE and dioptric shift.\n"

      "DESIGN: Development and evaluation of a classification system for myopic maculopathy based on observational case series.\n",
      "METHODS: A comprehensive set of myopic macular lesions was defined via literature review and through consensus meetings among retinal specialists and clinician scientists. A classification of myopic maculopathy was formulated based on fundus photographs and a modified Delphi process and consensus. Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility, assessed as agreement (%) and weighted kappa values, were evaluated. One hundred retinal photographs with myopia and myopic macular lesions were selected from case series at the High Myopia Clinic of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.\n",
      "RESULTS: We defined 5 categories of myopic maculopathy including \"no myopic retinal degenerative lesion\" (Category 0), \"tessellated fundus\" (Category 1), \"diffuse chorioretinal atrophy\" (Category 2), \"patchy chorioretinal atrophy\" (Category 3), and \"macular atrophy\" (Category 4). Three additional features to supplement these categories were defined as \"plus\" lesions, namely, lacquer cracks, myopic choroidal neovascularization, and Fuchs spot. Posterior staphyloma was considered as a further, important sign of myopic retinopathy. The intraobserver agreement was ≥85% and the corresponding weighted kappa statistic was ≥0.6 between observations. After a brief training session, interobserver kappa statistics reached the predefined satisfactory level (≥0.4), considered as above moderate agreement.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We propose a classification system for myopic maculopathy that was found to be reproducible. Applying a uniform classification in different studies will facilitate communication and comparison of findings from clinical trials and epidemiologic studies.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate an optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based positioning regimen for patients undergoing macular hole surgery.\n",
      "METHOD: We reviewed the medical records of all patients in our practice who underwent macular hole repair, instituting a modified OCT-based positioning regimen from November 1, 2011 through July 31, 2013. The regimen consisted of prone positioning at the conclusion of surgery with daily OCT imaging until the hole was confirmed closed at which point positioning was halted. Clinical data that were collected and recorded included visual acuities, stage of hole, size of hole, chronicity, preoperative and postoperative OCT imaging, and length of follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: We identified 33 patients (35 eyes) with a mean baseline visual acuity of 20/220, a mean hole size of 465 μm. The mean final (postoperative) visual acuity was 20/135 with a mean follow-up of 7.7 months. Six patients (17%) in our study were diagnosed with myopic degeneration. Thirteen patients (37%) were found to have chronic (≥12 months) holes, and 19 (54%) were found to have large holes (>400 μm). Overall, 28 eyes (80%) had persistent closure of macular holes with an OCT-based positioning regimen. In the absence of high risk factors, such as myopic degeneration, chronic or large holes, the closure rate was 92%. In the presence of 2 or 3 of these risk factors, the closure rate was 85% and 74%, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The presence of 2 or 3 high risk factors, such as myopic degeneration, chronic holes (≥12 months), or large holes (>400 μm) can compromise outcomes resulting in reopening after apparent early closure. Based on the presence of these risk factors, a modified postoperative positioning regimen can be used to obtain complete and persistent closure.\n"

      "Purpose. To describe the surgical technique and outcomes of combined Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty and medium incision manual cataract surgery (MICS) in Chinese eyes. Methods. Surgery was performed in 8 eyes of 7 patients (5 females, 2 males). Primary outcomes included success of the surgery and final outcomes. Results. Surgery was performed in patients with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy and cataract (mean age 75.5 ± 3.64 years). MICS tunnel was used to insert the donor lenticule into the anterior chamber. All surgeries were performed successfully. Graft dislocation was seen in 1 eye requiring repositioning with intracameral sulfur hexafluoride gas on the first postoperative day. Graft rejection was noted in one patient at the end of one year. The mean decimal best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.1 ± 0.07 to 0.3 ± 0.15. Suboptimal visual acuity in 2 cases was due to radiotherapy-related optic neuropathy (n = 1) and myopic maculopathy (n = 1). The mean target spherical refraction was -1.11 ± 0.17 diopters (myopic) and the mean achieved spherical refraction was 1.18 ± 0.87 diopters (hyperopic) resulting in a mean hyperopic shift of 2.2 diopters. Conclusions. The approach of combined Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty and MICS is a viable surgical technique for cases with endothelial dysfunction and cataract.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To observe changes in clotting time, plasma fibrinogen levels, and blood viscosity after intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) injection in patients with macular choroidal neovascularization (CNV).\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 77 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into a study group (n = 42 CNV patients) and a control group (n = 35 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects). Study group patients received IVR injections; control group patients received none. Clotting times, plasma fibrinogen levels and blood viscosity were evaluated before, and 1 week and 1 month after the first IVR injection, and again 1 month after the second injection in the study group, but only once in the control group. A paired-sample t-test was used to analyze data at four time points in the study group. Study group patients were further categorized as those with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD subgroup) or CNV secondary to pathological myopia (PM subgroup). Indicators were also analyzed for each subgroup.\n",
      "RESULTS: There were no significant differences between study and control group patients in baseline values. Results showed that 1 week after the first IVR injection, the mean activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of study group patients was significantly reduced compared with baseline values (27.88 ± 4.00 versus 30.70 ± 5.56 s), respectively. Low-, median- and high-shear viscosity rates were increased significantly compared with baseline values. No statistically significant changes in tested indicators were found at other time points. In AMD subgroup patients, changes in all indicators were similar to those found overall. In contrast, only changes in median- and high-shear viscosity rates were statistically significant in PM subgroup patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: IVR injection may cause short-term fluctuations in APTT and blood viscosity in AMD patients. Further studies are needed to establish the long-term safety of IVR treatment.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To describe the genotype-phenotype correlation and serial observations in a five-generation Czech family with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) associated with severe visual impairment in women.\n",
      "METHODS: Comprehensive ophthalmological examination including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed. Based on the pedigree structure and women being severely affected, autosomal dominant inheritance was suspected, and screening for known mutations by genotyping microarray was performed. Subsequently, direct sequencing of ORF15 RPGR was undertaken.\n",
      "RESULTS: Eighteen family members (nine women and nine men) were examined. A pathogenic variant, c.2543del in ORF15 of RPGR, was found to segregate with disease. The oldest woman and her two sisters had no perception of light in their sixth decade. Four women and five men had signs and symptoms of typical XLRP, including moderate to high myopia. Three other women also had moderate to high myopia and myopic astigmatism but without the presence of bone spicule-like formation. Severe disruption of macular architecture on SD-OCT was equally common in both sexes. Only one 32-year-old female carrier had clinically normal findings. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was decreased in all affected men and in all female carriers, except the only carrier with a normal fundus examination.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The c.2543del mutation in ORF15 of RPGR is associated with a severe phenotype in the women in this family. The presence of a significant myopic refractive error, in the absence of male-to-male transmission, may be indicative of X-linked inheritance. Measurements of choroidal thickness may help in clinically identifying carrier status.\n"

      "AIM: To elucidate the associations of iris color with major eye diseases.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic search on Medline with coverage up to August 2013 was conducted. Assessment of the quality of studies based on their levels of evidence was in accordance with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom.\n",
      "RESULTS: A relationship between darker iris color and an increased risk of age-related cataract has been reported from cross-sectional studies and prospective cohort studies. There was no consistent evidence supporting a major role of iris color in the development or progression of age-related macular degeneration. The association of iris color with ocular uveal melanoma has been confirmed by a meta-analysis of observational studies previously. The etiologic synergism between light iris color and environmental exposure such as UV the exposure of UV radiation was found. There were no studies evaluating the refractive associations with iris color but there may be a possible link between iris color and myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Darker iris color is associated with an increased risk of cataract and a reduced risk of ocular uveal melanoma. The association of iris color with age-related macular degeneration is not confirmed.

      " Clinical characteristics and current therapies for inherited retinal degenerations.\n",
      "Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) encompass a large group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases that affect approximately 1 in 3000 people (>2 million people worldwide) (Bessant DA, Ali RR, Bhattacharya SS. 2001. Molecular genetics and prospects for therapy of the inherited retinal dystrophies. Curr Opin Genet Dev 11: 307-316.). IRDs may be inherited as Mendelian traits or through mitochondrial DNA, and may affect the entire retina (e.g., rod-cone dystrophy, also known as retinitis pigmentosa, cone dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy, choroideremia, Usher syndrome, and Bardet-Bidel syndrome) or be restricted to the macula (e.g., Stargardt disease, Best disease, and Sorsby fundus dystrophy), ultimately leading to blindness. IRDs are a major cause of severe vision loss, with profound impact on patients and society. Although IRDs remain untreatable today, significant progress toward therapeutic strategies for IRDs has marked the past two decades. This progress has been based on better understanding of the pathophysiological pathways of these diseases and on technological advances.\n"

      " [Pathology of the vitreomacular interface].\n",
      "Vitreous role in the pathophysiology of retinal diseases has increased importantly over the recent years. This was possible using Optical Coherence Tomography which reviewed the way the vitreoretinal interface should be looked at and defined and classified new pathologies such as Vitreoretinal Traction Syndrome. Vitreous is not an empty space but an important anatomical structure with role in ocular physiology. With age biochemical changes occur so that vitreous starts to liquefy. Once the vitreous is liquefied (sinchisis) it collapses and passes in the retrohialoid space (sineresis). In complete PVD besides sinchisis there is a weakness of the adherence between the posterior cortex and ILM with total detachment of posterior cortex. Abnormal adhesions are associated with incomplete PVD. The definition and understanting of vitreoretinal pathology is an active and continuous process, PVD being the trigger of a lot of retinal pathologies: epiretinal membrane, macular hole, tractional macular oedema, VMTS, myopic traction maculopathy, exacerbations of exudative ARMD.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To determine the relationships between the levels of intraocular inflammatory cytokines and the clinical characteristics of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in eyes with myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "METHODS: One hundred eyes of 100 cases, including 51 mCNV eyes, 14 highly myopic eyes without choroidal neovascularization, and 35 normal subjects, were studied. The intraocular levels of choroidal neovascularization-related cytokines, like vascular endothelial growth factor, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-23, were determined.\n",
      "RESULTS: The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-8 were significantly higher in eyes with mCNV than in high myopia eyes without mCNV with significant odds ratio of 2.00 and 2.25 per quartile, respectively (P < 0.05). When myopic lesions of patients with mCNV were classified into 3 categories based on the severity, IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly elevated depending on the presence of maculopathy (P < 0.05). Vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly elevated in eyes of Category 2. An advancement of the maculopathy category was significantly associated with the need for multiple treatment of intravitreal bevacizumab (P < 0.05). In 12 eyes that required multiple intravitreal bevacizumab, the MCP-1 level was significantly elevated.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The significant associations of mCNV in highly myopic eyes with elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor or inflammatory cytokines and maculopathy lesions strongly suggest an involvement of inflammation in the etiology of mCNVs.\n"

      "INTRODUCTION: Many retinal specialists have utilized intravitreal bevacizumab as an anti-VEGF to treat choroidal neovascularization (CNV), secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and pathological myopia, with favorable results. Bevacizumab is currently approved only for the systemic treatment of colon carcinoma, whereas it is widely used off-label for treating ocular neovascular diseases.\n",
      "AREAS COVERED: In this review, after thorough search, 33 relevant studies conducted in the last 4 years were found. These articles comprised 14 studies about use of bevacizumab alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents to treat exudative AMD, and 19 studies on the use of myopic CNV.\n",
      "EXPERT OPINION: Although bevacizumab is widely used as an anti-VEGF agent for the treatment of exudative AMD, data on its systemic side effects are limited because of studies' short follow-up periods, absence of appropriate controls, limitation in reporting outcomes, and lack of controlled clinical trials in Phase III. Some safety studies demonstrated no difference between bevacizumab and ranibizumab in occurrence of heart attacks or stroke. Conducting proper randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up is crucial to make sure about efficacy and safety of bevacizumab.\n"

      " Visual consequences of refractive errors in the general population.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency and causes of visual impairment in relation to refractive error.\n",
      "DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6597 participants from Rotterdam Study I (baseline and 4 follow-up examinations) and 2579 participants from Rotterdam Study II (baseline and 2 follow-up examinations), all 55 years or older, were included.\n",
      "METHODS: Participants underwent an extensive ophthalmic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity and objective refraction, fundus photography, visual field perimetry, and optical coherence tomography imaging of macula and optic disc. We calculated cumulative risks and odds ratios of visual impairment for various refractive error categories and determined causes by using all screening information as well as medical records.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unilateral and bilateral low vision (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria, VA < 0.3 and VA ≥ 0.05; United States (US) criteria, VA < 0.5 and VA ≥ 0.1) and blindness (WHO criteria, VA < 0.05; US criteria, VA < 0.1).\n",
      "RESULTS: Cumulative risks of visual impairment ranged from virtually 0 in all refractive error categories at 55 years of age to 9.5% (standard error, 0.01) for emmetropia and 15.3% (standard error, 0.06) for high hyperopia to 33.7% (standard error, 0.08) for high myopia at 85 years of age. The major causes of visual impairment in highly hyperopic persons were age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract, and combined causes (each 25%); in highly myopic persons, the major cause was myopic macular degeneration (38.9%). The major causes of visual impairment for the other refractive error categories were AMD and cataract. Compared with those with emmetropia, those with high myopia had a significantly increased lifetime risk of visual impairment; those with -6 diopters (D) or less and -10 D or more had an odds ratio (OR) risk of 3.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.2) of visual impairment; those with less than -10 D had an OR of 22.0 (95% CI, 9.2-52.6).\n",

      "RESULTS: Mean postoperative follow-up was 25.2 ± 28.6 months (range 3-84 months). BSCVA at last visit was 7/10 or better in 6 eyes, 4/10 in 1 eye, and 2/10 or worse in 3 eyes, of which all had myopic maculopathy or deep amblyopia. Mean postoperative spherical equivalent was -3.4 ± 1.2 diopters. Mean endothelial cell loss in comparison to preoperative donor endothelial cell density was 21.3% ± 7.7%. Minor PCIOL decentration was seen in 1 patient, and IOL exchange was required in another patient owing to high postoperative refractive error. One graft rejection leading to graft failure was seen and was excluded from endothelial cell loss calculation.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: An operation combining phakic IOL removal, DSAEK, cataract removal, and PCIOL implantation can offer fast visual rehabilitation with good visual results and graft survival.\n"

      " Myopic traction maculopathy.\n",
      "Myopic traction maculopathy is a high myopia-related complication caused by several mechanisms with traction as a common pathway. Macular hole-related retinal detachment is considered to be the final stage of progressive foveoschisis. In this setting, release of all vitreous and epiretinal tractions is essential in order to achieve surgical success. Pars plana vitrectomy has proven useful in the treatment of myopic foveoschisis, with both good visual and anatomical results. However, the surgical technique for the treatment of macular hole-related retinal detachment is still a controversial issue: reoperations are common and the final visual prognosis is limited, especially in those cases with a pronounced posterior staphyloma. We must also bear in mind that a highly myopic eye has some characteristic traits that may complicate vitreoretinal surgery. In these cases, microincision vitrectomy surgery may offer some advantages compared to conventional vitrectomy.\n",

      " Suprachoroidal buckling.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of suprachoroidal buckling procedure using a suprachoroidal catheter, or cannula, as a new approach to treating different forms of retinal detachment, including myopic traction maculopathy, myopic macular holes, and peripheral retinal breaks by creating a suprachoroidal indentation (buckling effect) using a suprachoroidal filler.\n",
      "METHODS: We used specially designed devices, guided in the suprachoroidal space to reach the target space (retinal tear). Then we injected a suprachoroidal filler (long-lasting hyaluronic acid) to indent the choroid creating a suprachoroidal buckle to close retinal tears and support the retina. This was done to both central (myopic macular) holes in areas of the staphyloma as well as for treating peripheral retinal breaks. This technique can be used alone or during vitrectomy.\n",
      "RESULTS: In myopic patients, retinal layer restoration was achieved in all eyes with myopic foveoschisis. Of the 12 eyes, 10 with macular hole detachment (83%) showed closure of the holes in association with the resolution of the detachment; 2 eyes showed resolution of the detachment and flattening of the edge of the holes, but with incomplete closure on optical coherence tomography. Eight eyes (66.6%) showed improvement in visual acuity by one or more lines with no recurrence of retinal detachment over the 24-month follow-up period. The indentation effect was sufficient over the 24-month follow-up period. For peripheral retinal breaks, tears treated with this technique were all adequately buckled and closed from one procedure. A well-controlled location and support distribution of the buckle was possible through the suprachoroidal space. The buckling effect was enough to seal the tears and support the chorioretinal scarring time needed for tear healing. This also could be controlled by the filler duration time (filler type). The procedure was safe and relatively simple in reaching the treatment area and injecting it.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The indentation effect achieved by the suprachoroidal approach can be used as a method for managing myopic foveoschisis and myopic macular hole with detachment even in eyes with failed primary vitrectomy, counteracting the role of posterior staphyloma in the role of the disease. This technique is also feasible for treating retinal tears, supporting the retina, and treating selected forms of retinal detachment including subsilicone inferior recurrent retinal detachment. It can be done separately or in association with vitrectomy procedures. It adds to our surgical options in treating selected cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and avoids some potential problems of episcleral buckles as well as vitrectomy in selected cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.\n"

      "Mutations in the OPN1LW (L-) and OPN1MW (M-)cone opsin genes underlie a spectrum of cone photoreceptor defects from stationary loss of color vision to progressive retinal degeneration. Genotypes of 22 families with a range of cone disorders were grouped into three classes: deletions of the locus control region (LCR); missense mutation (p.Cys203Arg) in an L-/M-hybrid gene; and exon 3 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interchange haplotypes in an otherwise normal gene array. Moderate-to-high myopia was observed in all mutation categories. Individuals with LCR deletions or p.Cys203Arg mutations were more likely to have nystagmus and poor vision, with disease progression in some p.Cys203Arg patients. Three disease-associated exon 3 SNP haplotypes encoding LIAVA, LVAVA, or MIAVA were identified in our cohort. These patients were less likely to have nystagmus but more likely to show progression, with all patients over the age of 40 years having marked macular abnormalities. Previously, the haplotype LIAVA has been shown to result in exon 3 skipping. Here, we show that haplotypes LVAVA and MIAVA also result in aberrant splicing, with a residual low level of correctly spliced cone opsin. The OPN1LW/OPN1MW:c.532A>G SNP, common to all three disease-associated haplotypes, appears to be principally responsible for this mutational mechanism.\n"

      "METHODS: A retrospective observational case series of three patients who underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination and multimodal imaging with fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography.\n",
      "RESULTS: In all 3 eyes of 3 patients, aged 55 years to 63 years, there was Type 1 neovascularization overlying a localized area of choroidal thickening and dilated choroidal vessels seen with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. With indocyanine green angiography, there were large choroidal veins and choroidal hyperpermeability seen beneath the area of the neovascular tissue in all three eyes. No eyes had evidence of submacular exudative detachment or autofluorescence changes to suggest antecedent acute or chronic central serous chorioretinopathy. No eyes had drusen or degenerative changes to suggest age-related macular degeneration or other degenerative diseases. In one patient, the fellow unaffected eye demonstrated retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities, best seen with fundus autofluorescence, overlying focal dilated choroidal vessels seen with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography and associated choroidal hyperpermeability seen with indocyanine green angiography, consistent with the diagnosis of pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy. All three eyes showed the appearance of polypoidal structures within the neovascular tissue.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Pachychoroid neovasculopathy falls within a spectrum of diseases associated with choroidal thickening that includes pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and should be considered as a possible diagnosis in eyes with features of Type 1 neovascularization and choroidal thickening in the absence of characteristic age-related macular degeneration or degenerative changes. Pachychoroid neovasculopathy may occur as a focal abnormality within the macula, even in myopic eyes with normal subfoveal choroidal thickness. Pachychoroid neovasculopathy can ultimately progress to the development of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.\n",

      "PURPOSE: More than 50 genes are reported as causative genes of autosomal recessive (ar) retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and cone-rod dystrophy (CRD). It is challenging to identify causative mutations for arRP and arCRD. The purpose of the present study was to investigate clinical and genetic features of two siblings with early-onset retinal dystrophy.\n",
      "METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was conducted for the two affected siblings and their unaffected brother and mother from a Japanese family. We performed complete ophthalmic examinations, including visual acuity, funduscopy, visual-field testing, electroretinography and optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing analysis identified novel compound heterozygous mutations, a splice site mutation (c.374 + 2T > C in intron 4) and a deletion mutation (c.575delC [p.T192MfsX28] in exon 6) of chromosome 8 open reading frame 37 (C8orf37) gene, which encodes a ciliary protein, in both patients. The mother carried the truncating mutation, and the brother carried neither mutation. Ophthalmic examinations revealed diffuse retinal degeneration, macular atrophy, non-recordable electroretinography responses, cataracts, and high myopia in both patients, who could not be diagnosed with either RP or CRD because of the severe retinal degeneration and early onset disease. Longitudinal follow-up of the patients revealed highly progressive retinal degeneration, macular atrophy, and visual field loss.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Recessive C8orf37 mutations have been identified in early to adolescent-onset arRP and arCRD with macular involvement. Our study identified two novel truncating mutations of the C8orf37 gene in siblings with early-onset retinal dystrophy, macular atrophy, cataracts, and high myopia.\n"

Patients with high myopia were included and medical charts were reviewed. High myopia was defined as axial length ≥26.5 mm in at least one eye. Myopic maculopathy was defined as the presence of lacquer cracks, focal areas of deep choroidal atrophy, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, and macular choroidal neovascularization or geographic atrophy in the presence of high myopia. Systolic blood pressure measurements were collected, and fundus photography and optical coherence tomography were performed. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) shown on optical coherence tomography was measured and recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: The medical records of 187 high-myopic patients (87 without and 100 with maculopathy) were reviewed. Patients with maculopathy were older (56.96 years vs. 42.95 years, p < 0.01), had longer axial length (29.96 mm vs. 27.31 mm, p < 0.01), thinner SFCT (49.71 μm vs. 155.77 μm, p < 0.01), higher systolic blood pressure (132.28 mmHg vs. 125.31 mmHg, p < 0.05), greater prevalence of hypertension (31% vs. 16%, p < 0.05), and longer history of hypertension (2.34 years vs. 0.59 years, p < 0.01) compared to patients without maculopathy. After multivariate adjustment, SFCT and axial length were the only significant factors for maculopathy.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Thinner SFCT and longer axial length are significant risk factors for myopic maculopathy. Unlike previous epidemiological surveys, results of this clinic-based study suggested that systolic blood pressure is not a significant factor for maculopathy.\n",

      " Suprachoroidal layer and suprachoroidal space delineating the outer margin of the choroid in swept-source optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To define the morphology of outer choroidal margins in swept-source optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of 180 eyes: 20 eyes of healthy volunteers, 20 eyes of myopic patients, and 20 eyes from each of the following groups: macular hole, lamellar macular hole, epiretinal membranes, drusen, dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neovascular AMD, and vitreomacular traction. A single 12-mm wide swept-source optical coherence tomography image for each of the examined eyes consisting of 1,024 A-scans has been created. The main outcome measure selected was to estimate the presence of suprachoroidal layer, as well as to estimate the ability to delineate the outer choroidoscleral boundary using the software available (DRI-OCT) and to determine its shape.\n",
      "RESULTS: Suprachoroidal layer was observed in 5% of healthy emmetropic eyes, in 50% of eyes with full-thickness macular holes, and in 60% of eyes with vitreomacular traction syndrome. It was also present in 50% of eyes with dry AMD and in 20% of eyes with neovascular AMD. The outer margin of the choroid in all eyes of the healthy volunteers and in eyes with macular diseases has been delineated correctly. In all healthy and myopic eyes, we recognized the outer choroidoscleral boundary as having a regular shape following the natural oval contour of the globe. In eyes with epiretinal membranes, macular hole, vitreomacular traction, and AMD, the outer choroidoscleral boundary was irregular; the choroid varied in thickness from point to point.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Swept-source optical coherence tomography enables exact visualization of the outer choroidoscleral boundary. Suprachoroidal layer consisting of two bands has been recognized, the upper of which is hyperreflective and the lower of which is hyporeflective. It may be supposed that the lower hyporeflective band corresponds to suprachoroidal space, which was not earlier visualized in vivo in eyes without choroidal effusion. Suprachoroidal layer in myopic and emmetropic healthy subjects has been rarely observed. We observed it more frequently in different macular diseases.\n"

      " Effects of a human VEGF antibody (Bevacizumab) on deprivation myopia and choroidal thickness in the chicken.\n",
      "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a dimeric glycoprotein which is responsible for neovascularization and fenestrations of the choriocapillaris. In neovascular maculopathies secondary to age-related degeneration (nAMD) or pathologic myopia (PM-CNV), its inhibition by humanized antibodies is currently the most successful therapy. The choroid has an important role in maintaining retinal health and its thickness declines with age and with myopia. Since choroidal thickness depends on its perfusion rate, one would expect that anti-VEGF agents can also change choroidal thickness. We have tested the hypothesis in the chicken model, using a humanized antibody, Bevacizumab, and also studied the distribution of VEGF-A in the chicken fundal layers by immunohistochemical techniques. Even though it was raised against human VEGF, Bevacizumab had several long lasting effects in the chicken eye (1) after a single unilateral intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg, it partially suppressed the development of deprivation myopia, similarly in both eyes, (2) it completely suppressed choroidal thickening that normally occurs when eyes recover from induced myopia over a time period of about 10 days, (3) it had little effect on the choroidal thickness in eyes that had normal visual experience, (4) VEGF-A was absent in sclera, but highly expressed in the walls of choroidal blood vessels and presumed nerve fiber bundles, as well as in retinal photoreceptors and cells of the inner and outer nuclear layer. One day after the injection of Bevacizumab, the immunoreactivity against VEGF-A had largely disappeared. In conclusion, Bevacizumab is similary effective in human and chicken tissue, has similar time constants (few days), has almost symmetrical effects on myopia in both eyes even after monocular application, and fully suppresses choroidal thickening that normally occurs during recovery from deprivation myopia. The mechanisms by which Bevacizumab acts on the choroidal thickness are perhaps most interesting, both to better understand the role of the choroid in myopia development but also to clarify its potential side effects during nAMD and PM-CNV treatment in the clinics.\n",

      "Degenerative ocular conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, and myopic degeneration, have become a major public health problem and a leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs seem to be an effective and safe treatment for these conditions. Ranibizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment, which inhibits all biologically active isoforms of VEGF-A, is still the gold standard treatment for the majority of these pathological entities. In this review, we present the results of the most important clinical trials concerning the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab for the treatment of degenerative ocular conditions.\n"

      " Genome-wide association study success in ophthalmology.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Much progress in our understanding of the genetic profile of many ophthalmic diseases has been made over the last decade. Identification of novel gene associations allows insight into the mechanisms of disease and potentially enables the identification of individuals at increased risk, as well as facilitating the development of new treatments. We highlight key recent discoveries using the genome-wide association study design.\n",
      "RECENT FINDINGS: Over the last 2 years, we have seen major international collaborations successfully conduct genome-wide association study to identify genetic pathways associated with eye diseases, such as myopia, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Similarly other studies have identified and confirmed genes associated with ocular biometry or disease-specific endophenotypes.\n",
      "SUMMARY: Our understanding of the genetic architecture of common eye diseases, such as myopia, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, is rapidly expanding. With reducing costs of next-generation sequencing, we expect a transition to large-scale interrogation at the whole exome and genome level, which will enable the identification of rare variants which confer a level of sensitivity and specificity to predict risk that will allow us to further understand, predict and intervene in genetic-based eye diseases.\n",

      " Aspheric intraocular lenses implantation for cataract patients with extreme myopia.\n",
      "Objective. To evaluate the postoperative visual quality of cataract patients with extreme myopia after implantation of aspheric intraocular lenses (IOLs). Methods. Thirty-three eyes were enrolled in this prospectivestudy. Eighteen eyes with an axial length longer than 28 mm were included in the extreme myopia group, and the other 15 eyes were included in the nonextreme myopia group. Phacoemulsification and aspheric IOL implantation were performed. Six months after cataract surgery, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity, and wavefront aberrations were measured, and subjective visual quality was assessed. Results. The BCVA improved significantly after surgery for both groups, and patients in the nonextreme myopia group achieved better postoperative BCVA due to better retinal status of the eyes. The evaluation of contrast sensitivity without glare was the same in both groups, whereas patients in the nonextreme myopia group performed better at intermediate spatial frequencies under glare conditions. The two groups did not show a significant difference in high-order aberrations. With regard to subjective visual quality, the composite scores of both groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions. Aspheric IOLs provided good visual outcomes in cataract patients with extreme myopia. These patients should undergo careful evaluation to determine the maculopathy severity level before surgery.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate the morphological features of myopic maculopathy with a new and noninvasive retro-mode imaging (RMI) technique using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope.\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 42 patients (69 eyes) with myopic maculopathy were included. RMI combined with fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography together were used to observe and evaluate the morphological features of disease.\n",
      "RESULTS: Four in 4 eyes (100%) with macular retinoschisis were found with a characteristic pattern by RMI (firework pattern centrally with surrounding fingerprint pattern). Twenty-four in 24 eyes (100%) with pigment proliferation were found by RMI as dark plain patches, and 23 in 24 eyes with hemorrhage (95.8%) were found by RMI as gray bump. Atrophy of different degrees (12 in 14 eyes, 85.7%) was found by RMI as an area of pseudo-3D choroidal vessels or a fuzzy shadow but both without a clear boundary. Choroidal neovascularization (12 in 16 eyes, 75%) was identified laboriously by RMI as a vague raised region. Lacquer cracks were difficult to figure out in RMI.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Retinoschisis, pigment proliferation, hemorrhage, and atrophy secondary to myopic maculopathy have characteristic morphologic features in RMI; however, choroidal neovascularization and lacquer crack are not easily distinguishable in RMI.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To examine the association between best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and subfoveal choroidal thickness.\n",
      "DESIGN: Population-based study.\n",
      "METHODS: The Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 subjects with ages of 50+ years. The participants underwent an ophthalmologic examination including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with enhanced depth imaging for measurement of choroidal thickness. BCVA was measured as logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 3468 participants, choroidal measurements were available for 3233 (93.2%) subjects. In multivariate analysis, better BCVA was significantly associated with thicker subfoveal choroid (P < 0.001) in general and a subfoveal choroid thicker than 30 μm (P < 0.001) in particular, after adjusting for younger age (P < 0.001), higher level of education (P < 0.001), taller body stature (P < 0.001), higher body mass index (P = 0.005), absence of glaucoma (P = 0.001), absence of diabetic retinopathy (P < 0.001), absence of late-stage age-related macular degeneration (P < 0.001), and axial length shorter than 26.0 mm (P < 0.001) (correlation coefficient r:0.56). If eyes with glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, late-stage age-related macular degeneration or myopic retinopathy were excluded, better BCVA was still significantly associated with thicker subfoveal choroid (P < 0.001) and subfoveal choroid thicker than 30 μm (P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. In a reverse manner, thicker subfoveal choroid was associated with better BCVA (P < 0.001) after adjusting for younger age (P < 0.001), male gender (P < 0.001), longer axial length (P < 0.001), and higher corneal curvature radius (P < 0.001).\n",

      "METHODS: It was a population-based cross-section study. Geographically defined cluster sampling was used in randomly selecting 5 841 individuals aged 50 years or above in 28 basic sample units in Shuangcheng City from September to December 2006. The survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance evaluation was carried out. All participants were enumerated through village registers followed door-to-door visits.Eligible individuals were invited to receive visual acuity measurement and eye examination. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE Statistical Software, release 9.0. Chi-square test was used to investigate the association of age, gender and education with presenting and best corrected visual acuity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Five thousands four hundreds and eighty-one individuals were enumerated and 5 047 persons were examined, the response rate was 92.08%. Based on the criteria of World Health Organization visual impairment classification in 1973, the prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe visual impairment defined as best corrected visual acuity was 1.72% (87/5 047) and 4.69% (237/5 047) respectively. The prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe visual impairment defined as presenting visual acuity was 1.90% (96/5 047) and 7.23% (365/5 047) respectively. The prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe visual impairment was higher in aged (trend χ(2)=674.44, P < 0.01), female (χ(2)=39.61, P < 0.01) and illiterate (trend χ(2)=142.82, P < 0.01) persons. Cataract (52.70%) was still the first leading cause of blindness and visual impairment. The percentage of the retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, high myopic retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy was 11.31% among the eyes with blindness and moderate and severe visual impairment. Un-corrected refractive error(13.38%) also was the main cause of visual impairment.\n",

Mild radiation complications such as radiation vasculopathy developed in 17.6% of patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: PBI is a safe and efficacious treatment for subfoveal CNV not due to AMD. The data with respect to visual outcomes and radiation complications trend in favour of the 16 CGE group, although differences do not reach statistical significance.

      "PURPOSE: To describe the outcomes of cataract surgery in adult patients with Down's syndrome at a tertiary eye hospital in Hong Kong.\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective case-file analysis was performed to identify patients with Downs's syndrome who underwent cataract surgery between January 2002 and December 2012. Morphology of cataract, associated ocular features and surgical and visual outcomes were analysed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Cataract surgery was performed in 33 eyes of 20 patients (12 males, 8 females, mean age 42.9±10.6 years) over a 10-year period. Nine patients (9/20, 45.0%) had bilateral cataracts at the time of diagnosis. White cataracts were noted in 12 eyes of 10 patients (12/33, 36.3%) at the time of presentation. Associated ocular problems included myopic maculopathy (18 eyes, 54.5%), keratoconus (12 eyes, 36.3%), nystagmus (2 eyes, 6.0%), corneal scar (2 eyes, 6.0%) and glaucoma (2 eyes, 6.0%). Five eyes (15.1%) underwent extracapsular cataract extraction whereas a phacoemulsification was performed in 28 (84.9%) eyes. Intraocular lens implantation was performed in 32/33 eyes. The most common postoperative complication was posterior capsular opacification (8 eyes, 24.2%). The mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.07±0.11 preoperatively to 0.17±0.19 at 3 months postoperatively (p=0.000).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence of bilateral cataracts as well as white cataracts was observed in patients with Down's syndrome in our study. Although the surgical outcomes of cataract surgery were good, the visual outcomes were suboptimal in our cases due to associated ocular comorbidities.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between pseudodrusen as evidenced by the presence of subretinal drusenoid deposits and choroidal thickness using a multimodal imaging approach.\n",
      "METHODS: Two sets of data were analyzed. The first set was composed of consecutive patients older than 60 years with either high myopia or pseudodrusen. Correlations were calculated between the subfoveal choroidal thickness and the presence of pseudodrusen. The second set of data was obtained from a previously published data examining 90 consecutive eyes with nonexudative age-related macular degeneration so that the relationship between pseudodrusen and subfoveal choroidal thickness could be analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: There were 96 eyes of 53 patients in the first data set, 36 (67.9%) were female and 17 (32.1%) were male. There were 34 patients (61 eyes) in the High Myopia group and 19 patients (35 eyes) in the Primary Pseudodrusen group. The mean age of the Primary Pseudodrusen group was 83.7 years and that of the High Myopia group was 74.9 years, a difference that was significant (P < 0.001). Of the 61 eyes in the High Myopia group, only 3 (4.9%) had pseudodrusen and 0 had conventional drusen. In the Primary Pseudodrusen group, all had pseudodrusen by definition, but 28 (80%) also had conventional drusen. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was 181.7 μm (median, 147; interquartile range, 65-225 μm) in the Primary Pseudodrusen group and 59 μm (median, 36; interquartile range, 21-90 μm) in the myopic group. Generalized estimating equation analysis showed that eyes with pseudodrusen had thicker subfoveal choroidal thickness than eyes without, a result driven by the High Myopia group. In the second set of data, while the absolute number of eyes with pseudodrusen had a choroidal thickness between 201 μm and 250 μm, the proportion with pseudodrusen was higher in eyes with thinner choroids, with a broad peak between 50 μm and 100 μm.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our results are not consistent with a simple cause or consequence relationship between pseudodrusen and choroidal thinning, but rather with a third yet unknown factor impacting both the pseudodrusen appearance and the choroidal thinning in susceptible populations. The reasons for the relative lack of drusen and pseudodrusen formation in high myopes need to be ascertained.\n"

      " Relationship between macular bending and foveoschisis in myopic patients.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate factors associated with myopic foveoschisis and macular bending and to determine how the presence of macular bending affects the development of myopic foveoschisis.\n",
      "METHODS: In a prospective study of 194 eyes of 105 patients with high myopia, we performed complete ophthalmic examinations, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and A-scan ultrasounds. Patients were divided into three groups according to the OCT results. Group 1 consisted of 25 eyes (17 patients) with myopic foveoschisis; group 2 consisted of 36 eyes (20 patients) with macular bending; and group 3 consisted of 135 eyes (68 patients) without macular bending, foveoschisis, or other diseases. Macular bending was defined as a smooth macular elevation observed upon OCT in patients with pathologic myopia. Age, sex, spherical equivalence, axial length (AXL), and OCT findings were obtained and compared to identify factors that are related to myopic foveoschisis and macular bending. Moreover, using the whole data set, we evaluated and correlated myopic foveoschisis with the presence or absence of macular bending to determine whether this bulge in the macular area influences the development of myopic foveoschisis.\n",
      "RESULTS: In group 1, all eyes presented posterior staphyloma and two factors were independently associated with a higher risk of having myopic foveoschisis: internal limiting membrane detachment (p < 0.001) and retinal arteriolar traction (p < 0.001). In group 2, only retinal arteriolar traction (p < 0.009) was independently associated with macular bending. Furthermore, macular bending was significantly correlated as a protective factor against myopic foveoschisis (adjusted odds ratio, 0.116; 95% confidence interval, 0.019 to 0.701; p < 0.019); the AXL of patients with the same spherical equivalence and macular bending was significantly shorter than that of patients without macular bending (p = 0.005).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular and extraocular wall factors were associated with myopic traction maculopathy, which plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Moreover, macular bending might be a key factor in preventing myopic foveoschisis by decreasing AXL.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: To report the optical coherence tomographic (OCT) findings in 4 eyes before and after a spontaneous resolution of a myopic traction maculopathy (MTM).\n",
      "METHOD: Retrospective review of medical records including history, examination findings, fundus details, and finding of spectral-domain OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg) findings in 4 eyes with a spontaneous resolution of MTM.\n",
      "RESULTS: A release of the vitreofoveal traction was detected by OCT in 3 eyes before the resolution of the MTM. A vitreofoveal separation in one eye and an increase in the length of a vitreous strand from the macula in two eyes indicated a reduction in the traction. In 2 eyes, an internal limiting membrane (ILM) detachment was seen by OCT as a membrane above the wrinkled inner retina at the perifoveal lesion, and a flattening of the ILM and inner retina was detected after the resolution. The detached ILM was shifted centrifugally on the macula and disappeared with the flattening of the adjacent retina which suggests that the release of tangential traction was caused by the dehiscence of ILM possibly at the proximal edges of the ILM detachment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Releasing a vitreofoveal traction and flattening of the detached ILM may be signs of spontaneous resolution of a MTM. Vitrectomy is not required when these signs are detected.\n"

      "DESIGN: Retrospective case series and literature review.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: A total of 17 patients from 5 institutions.\n",
      "METHODS: Detailed case history, multimodal imaging, and genetic testing were reviewed for patients with macular schisis without a known predisposing condition. Patients with a stellate appearance centered on the fovea with correlating confirmed expansion of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were included.

      "RESULTS: A total of 22 eyes from 16 female patients and 1 male patient with foveomacular schisis were reviewed from 5 institutions. Initial visual acuity was ≥ 20/50 in all eyes (mean, 20/27), but visual acuity in a single eye decreased from 20/20 to 20/200 after the development of subfoveal fluid. The refractive status was myopic in 16 eyes, plano in 3 eyes, and hyperopic in 2 eyes. Three eyes had a preexisting vitreous separation, and 19 eyes had an attached posterior hyaloid. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to >5 years.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this largest known series of patients with SNIFR, all patients demonstrated splitting of the OPL in the macula with relatively preserved visual acuity (≥ 20/40) except in a single patient in whom subretinal fluid developed under the fovea.\n"

      " Suprachoroidal buckling: technique and indications.\n",
      "The authors herein report the feasibility of suprachoroidal buckling (SCB) procedure as a new approach for treating different forms of retinal detachment (RD) by creating suprachoroidal indentation (buckling effect). With this technique, specially designed devices, i.e. a catheter or cannula, are guided in the suprachoroidal space to reach the target area. Then, a suprachoroidal filler (long lasting hyaluronic acid) is injected to indent the choroid creating SCB, thereby closing retinal tears and supporting the overlying retina. This procedure was performed to treat both myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM), including myopic macular holes, as well as peripheral retinal breaks. SCB may be used alone or in conjunction with vitrectomy. In myopic patients, restoration of retinal layers was achieved in all eyes with myopic foveoschisis. Most eyes with macular hole detachments demonstrated closure of the holes. All peripheral retinal breaks were adequately buckled and closed in a single procedure. The buckling effect was long enough in duration to seal the tears and promote adequate chorioretinal scarring. The procedure was safe and relatively simple in terms of reaching the treatment area and injecting the filler. SCB adds to our surgical options for treating selected cases of peripheral retinal tears and rhegmatogenous RD, and avoids potential problems of episcleral buckles. Moreover it may avoid vitrectomy in selected cases of rhegmatogenous RD.\n"

      " The relationship between intervention in the CD40 signal pathway and choroidal neovascularization.\n",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, ocular trauma, and other eye diseases can cause choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In recent years, photodynamic therapy (PDT), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications, laser treatment, and other measures against CNV have been gradually applied in the clinical setting and in some cases have achieved good results. However, the pathogenesis of CNV has not been fully elucidated. The costimulatory system made up of cluster of differentiation 40 protein (CD40) and its ligand (CD40L) is an important signal transduction pathway among immune cells. The activation of CD40 can also stimulate the secretion of a variety of angiogenic growth factors (eg, VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factors that might lead to CNV. The high level expression of CD40 and CD40L has been detected in CNV diseases. Interference with the CD40 signaling pathway may become a new target for CNV treatment. We review the relationship between CD40, CD40L, and CNV.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between major ocular diseases and mortality.\n",
      "METHODS: The population-based longitudinal study Beijing Eye Study was performed in 2001 and repeated in 2011. The participants underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination at baseline in 2001.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 4439 subjects examined in 2001, 2695 (60.7%) subjects returned for the follow-up examination in 2011, while 379 (8.5%) subjects were dead and 1365 (30.8%) subjects were alive, however, did not agree to be re-examined. In multivariate regression analysis, mortality was significantly associated with the systemic parameters of older age (p < 0.001; Odds ratio (OR): 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05, 1.09), male gender (p < 0.001; OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.78), lower level of education (p < 0.001; OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.74) and smoking (p < 0.001; OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.49) and with the ocular parameters of presence of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.002; OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.81), non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage (p = 0.001; OR: 4.90; 95% CI: 1.90, 12.7) and higher degree of nuclear cataract (p = 0.002; OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.52). In that model, mortality was not significantly (all p > 0.05) associated with refractive error, cortical or subcapsular posterior cataract, intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity, visual field defects, prevalence of age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusions, open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for age, gender, level of education and smoking, mortality was significantly higher in subjects with diabetic retinopathy, non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage and nuclear cataract. Other major ophthalmic parameters and disorders such as hyperopia, myopia, high myopia, pterygium, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, glaucoma and cortical or nuclear cataract were not significantly associated with mortality in the multivariate analysis.\n"

      "RESULTS: Fourteen studies comprising over 5800 patients were eligible. Significant associations were found between hyperopia, myopia, per-diopter increase in SE, per-millimeter increase in AL, and prevalent early AMD.

The per-diopter increase in SE was also significantly associated with early AMD incidence (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10). However, no significant association was found between hyperopia or myopia and early AMD incidence. Furthermore, neither prevalent nor incident late AMD was associated with refractive error. Considerable heterogeneity was found among studies investigating the association between myopia and prevalent early AMD (P = 0.001, I2 = 72.2%). Geographic location might play a role; the heterogeneity became non-significant after stratifying these studies into Asian and non-Asian subgroups.\n",

      " Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies in ophthalmology: current use, controversies and the future.\n",
      "Use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies was introduced for the treatment of ocular disorders in 2005. In the UK, the current licensed and NICE approved indications are for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), macular oedema secondary to a retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and choroidal neovascularization in pathological myopia. These diagnoses alone account for two-thirds of the main causes of legally registrable visual impairment and blindness. Ranibizumab (Lucentis®; Genentech/Novartis), a drug specifically designed for intraocular use, is the primary licensed medication. Controversially however, clinicians have been using an unlicensed cheaper drug, bevacizumab (Avastin®; Genentech/Roche), originally designed for systemic administration, with a similar mode of action and shown to have a similar efficacy. However, there are fears of greater side effects with bevacizumab though studies have not been sufficiently powered to show statistical difference. In the current global economic climate, anti-VEGF treatment places huge financial and logistical pressure on already strained health care systems. Bevacizumab is considerably more cost effective than ranibizumab, and thus using bevacizumab would widen access to treatment particularly in developing countries. This licensing issue also places clinicians in a difficult medico-legal position especially in Europe, where doctors are duty bound to use a licensed drug for a particular indication if this is available. As the indications of anti-VEGF therapies expand and the cost of health care provision becomes more expensive, the controversies surrounding their use will inevitably become more important.\n"

      "Myopic traction maculopathy is a group of ocular fundus diseases related to high myopia, which can severely impact on patients' visual function. It is well recognized that the abnormal of macular structure and function in the disease are resulted from various traction mechanisms, including the forces from posterior vitreous detachment, posterior vitreous cortex, and macular epiretinal membrane which acting on the inner retina, the force from posterior staphyloma which acting on the outer retina, and retinal intrinsic features such as the changes of inner limiting membrane and arterioles. The treatments are mainly based on surgery, including vitrectomy and scleral reinforcement surgery in order to relieve the retinal traction. The options of specific surgery procedures are still under debated. In this article, we reviewed the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of myopic traction maculopathy.\n",

      " Translating the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements Project findings to the clinic: ENCODE's implications for eye disease.\n",
      "Approximately 10 years after the Human Genome Project unravelled the sequence of our DNA, the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project sought to interpret it. Data from the recently completed project have shed new light on the proportion of biologically active human DNA, assigning a biochemical role to much of the sequence previously considered to be 'junk'. Many of these newly catalogued functional elements represent epigenetic mechanisms involved in regulation of gene expression. Analogous to an Ishihara plate, a gene-coding region of DNA (target dots) only comes into context when the non-coding DNA (surrounding dots) is appreciated. In this review we provide an overview of the ENCODE project, discussing the significance of these data for ophthalmic research and eye disease. The novel insights afforded by the ENCODE project will in time allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies in the management of common blinding disorders.\n",

      " Sorting out co-occurrence of rare monogenic retinopathies: Stargardt disease co-existing with congenital stationary night blindness.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Inherited retinal diseases are uncommon, and the likelihood of having more than one hereditary disorder is rare. Here, we report a case of Stargardt disease and congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in the same patient, and the identification of two novel in-frame deletions in the GRM6 gene.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient underwent an ophthalmic exam and visual function testing including: visual acuity, color vision, Goldmann visual field, and electroretinography (ERG). Imaging of the retina included fundus photography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fundus autofluorescence. Genomic DNA was PCR-amplified for analysis of all coding exons and flanking splice sites of both the ABCA4 and GRM6 genes.\n",
      "RESULTS: A 46-year-old woman presented with recently reduced central vision and clinical findings of characteristic yellow flecks consistent with Stargardt disease. However, ERG testing revealed an ERG phenotype unusual for Stargardt disease but consistent with CSNB1. Genetic testing revealed two previously reported mutations in the ABCA4 gene and two novel deletions in the GRM6 gene.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of concurrent Stargardt disease and CSNB was made on the ophthalmic history, clinical examination, ERG, and genetic testing. This case highlights that clinical tests need to be taken in context, and that co-existing retinal dystrophies and degenerations should be considered when clinical impressions and objective data do not correlate.\n"

      " Myopia, an underrated global challenge to vision: where the current data takes us on myopia control.\n",
      "Myopia is the most frequent cause of distance impairment in the world and is creating an alarming global epidemic with deleterious ramifications for the quality of life and economic health of individuals and nations as a whole. In addition to being immediately disadvantageous, myopia increases the risk of serious disorders such as myopic macular degeneration, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataract and is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness across many countries. The reduction in age of onset of myopia is of great concern since the earlier the onset, the more myopic the individual will become, with all the attendant increased risks of accompanying debilitating eye conditions. The economic burden is great; both in consequences of uncorrected refractive error and also in the provision of devices for correcting visual acuity. Earlier onset of myopia increases the lifetime economic burden related to loss of productivity and independence, leading to a reduced quality of life. Recent data suggest addressing accommodation per se has little direct amelioration of myopia progression. Pharmacological interventions that effect changes in the sclera show promising efficacy, whereas optical interventions based on a myopic shift in the retinal image are proving to effect up to 55% reduction in the rate of progression of myopia. Early contact lens and spectacle interventions that reduce the rate of progression of myopia are able to significantly reduce the burden of myopia. These non-pharmacological interventions show profound promise in reducing the overall associated morbidity of myopia.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To compare the choroidal volume (CV) between emmetropic and highly myopic eyes, and to assess if the presence of myopic fundus abnormalities, myopic traction maculopathy, or choroidal neovascularization affects the CV.\n",
      "METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed imaging studies of 98 eyes of 98 patients who underwent CV measurement on optical coherence tomography. We included 31 emmetropic eyes (Group 1), 36 highly myopic eyes without vitreoretinal or choroidal pathologies (Group 2), 21 highly myopic eyes with traction maculopathy (Group 3), and 10 highly myopic eyes with history of choroidal neovascularization (Group 3). Eyes with chorioretinal atrophy were excluded. Regression analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between CV and multiple variables.\n",
      "RESULTS: Choroidal volume was lower in Group 2 than in Group 1 (P < 0.001), and in Groups 3 and 4 than in Group 2 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Age (P = 0.002), axial length (P < 0.001), sex (P = 0.047), staphyloma (P < 0.001), and myopic group (P = 0.05) were independent predictors for the final CV (R = 0.645). In highly myopic eyes, CV decreased by 0.32 mm for every 10 years and by 0.49 mm per millimeter of axial length.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Choroidal thinning is present in highly myopic eyes compared with emmetropic eyes, and is related to age, axial length, sex, and staphyloma. However, myopic eyes with coexisting myopic traction maculopathy or history of choroidal neovascularization have more severe thinning, likely leading to insufficient metabolic supplementation for the macula.\n"

      "METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with pathologic myopia and chorioretinal atrophy in at least one eye, with and without focal scleral ectasia, were analyzed by infrared reflectance (IR) and/or multicolor imaging, enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) (39 patients, 78 eyes), and swept source (SS)-OCT (13 out of 39 patients, 26 eyes) cross-sectional scan.\n",
      "RESULTS: Focal scleral ectasia was found in 12 out of 68 eyes (11 out of 39 consecutive patients, 27 females/12 males; mean age 65.7 ± 11.9 years) with macular/perimacular patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and was always observed inferior or temporal to the macula (mean 1.25 ± 0.38/eye). Focal scleral ectasia, appearing on fundus examination as a deep dark round/oval lesion with well-defined borders, was characterized on EDI-OCT and SS-OCT by an abrupt posterior bow of the sclera with different degrees of scleral schisis on its borders. The retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid were absent in all lesions. IR reflectance and multicolor imaging showed large vessels that seem to emerge from the focal scleral ectasia, and crossing the area of patchy atrophy. EDI-OCT and SS-OCT revealed retrobulbar vessels perforating the sclera at the borders/bottom of the abrupt posterior bow of the sclera (i.e., focal scleral ectasia) and running through the superficial scleral thickness for the whole extension of the atrophic area.\n",

      " Topical application of PPADS inhibits complement activation and choroidal neovascularization in a model of age-related macular degeneration.\n",
      "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness among the elderly. AMD patients have elevated levels of membrane attack complex (MAC) in their choroidal blood vessels and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). MAC forms pores in cell membranes. Low levels of MAC result in an elevation of cytokine release such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes the formation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). High levels of MAC result in cell lysis and RPE degeneration is a hallmark of advanced AMD. The current standard of care for CNV associated with wet AMD is intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF molecules every 4 to 12 weeks. Such injections have significant side effects. Recently, it has been found that membrane pore-forming proteins such as α-haemolysin can mediate their toxic effects through auto- and paracrine signaling and that complement-induced lysis is amplified through ATP release followed by P2X receptor activation. We hypothesized that attenuation of P2X receptor activation may lead to a reduction in MAC deposition and consequent formation of CNV. Hence, in this study we investigated topical application of the purinergic P2X antagonist Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) as a potential treatment for AMD. We found that 4.17 µM PPADS inhibited formation of HUVEC master junctions and master segments by 74.7%. In a human complement mediated cell lysis assay, 104 µM PPADS enabled almost complete protection of Hepa1c1c7 cells from 1% normal human serum mediated cell lysis. Daily topical application of 4.17 mM PPADS for 3 days attenuated the progression of laser induced CNV in mice by 41.8% and attenuated the deposition of MAC at the site of the laser injury by 19.7%. Our data have implications for the future treatment of AMD and potentially other ocular disorders involving CNV such as angioid streaks, choroidal rupture and high myopia.\n"

      "PURPOSE: 48,XXYY syndrome was first described in 1964 and approximately 100 cases have been reported in the literature. We report a case of 48,XXYY syndrome associated with high myopia and retinal dysfunction.\n",
      "METHODS: Case report.\n",
      "RESULTS: A 28-year-old man was referred with progressive deterioration of visual acuity (VA) bilaterally during the previous 4-5 years. Physical examination revealed tall stature, large feet and irregular teeth. Refraction revealed high myopia with VA 6/60 bilaterally. Fundoscopy revealed a normal vitreous, lightly pigmented retinal pigment epithelium and choroid but no bone spicules or overt signs of retinal degeneration. His visual fields were constricted. Electrodiagnostic testing revealed bilateral generalised retinal dysfunction with severe macular involvement. During follow-up, his ophthalmic examination did not exhibit significant changes while VA was gradually deteriorating. Eight years after presentation, VA was 3/60 bilaterally; electrophysiological testing showed no further change. At that stage, his parents consented for DNA analysis in order to determine the cause of retinal dysfunction. Chromosomal analysis revealed an abnormal male karyotype with two X chromosomes and two Y chromosomes consistent with 48,XXYY syndrome.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The present report is the first to describe retinal dysfunction and high myopia with 48,XXYY syndrome. The severe macular and generalised retinal dysfunction in this case are not those associated with myopia and are in keeping with a primary retinal dysfunction. A coincidental finding cannot be excluded, but ERGs have not previously been reported in 48,XXYY syndrome, and retinal dystrophy may be a previously undiagnosed component of this syndrome.\n"

      "METHODS: The medical records of 71 eyes of 64 patients with myopic traction maculopathy and high myopia (≤-8.0 diopters and axial length, ≥26.0 mm) were reviewed. Twenty-six eyes had only macular retinoschisis, 30 eyes had foveal detachment, and 15 eyes had macular hole.

      " Natural course of myopic traction maculopathy and factors associated with progression or resolution.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the natural course of myopic traction maculopathy and to identify the factors associated with its progression or resolution in 207 highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, consecutive case series.\n",
      "METHODS: We investigated 207 highly myopic eyes with myopic traction maculopathy by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and followed the patients for at least 24 months. The size of the macular retinoschisis was categorized according to its extent and location relative to the fovea. The clinical data, status of the myopic traction maculopathy, and changes in the posterior vitreous and inner limiting membrane (ILM) were analyzed during the natural course of the disease process.\n",
      "RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 36.2 ± 6.2 months, 8 of 207 eyes (3.9%) showed a decrease or complete resolution of the macular retinoschisis. Of these 8 eyes, 6 had release of retinal traction in the OCT images, and 4 of the 6 eyes developed posterior vitreous detachment. A spontaneous disruption of the ILM occurred in 2 eyes before the improvement of the myopic traction maculopathy. Of the 207 eyes, 24 (11.6%) experienced progression of the myopic traction maculopathy. The eyes with more extensive macular retinoschisis showed progression significantly more commonly (42.9%) than the eyes having less extensive macular retinoschisis areas (6.7%).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The natural course of myopic traction maculopathy varies, and eyes with more extensive macular retinoschisis tend to progress more commonly. A complete resolution of macular retinoschisis can occur after a release of traction on the retina. These findings can be used to determine whether surgery should be performed.\n"

      " Advances in the genomics of common eye diseases.\n",
      "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other genomic technologies have accelerated the discovery of genes and genomic regions contributing to common human ocular disorders with complex inheritance. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma and myopia account for the majority of visual impairment worldwide. Over 19 genes and/or genomic regions have been associated with AMD. Current investigations are assessing the clinical utility of risk score panels and therapies targeting disease-specific pathways. DR is the leading cause of blindness in the United States and globally is a major cause of vision loss. Genomic investigations have identified molecular pathways associated with DR in animal models which could suggest novel therapeutic targets. Three types of glaucoma, primary-open-angle glaucoma (POAG), angle-closure glaucoma and exfoliation syndrome (XFS) glaucoma, are common age-related conditions. Five genomic regions have been associated with POAG, three with angle-closure glaucoma and one with XFS. Myopia causes substantial ocular morbidity throughout the world. Recent large GWAS have identified >20 associated loci for this condition. In this report, we present a comprehensive overview of the genes and genomic regions contributing to disease susceptibility for these common blinding ocular disorders and discuss the next steps toward translation to effective gene-based screening tests and novel therapies targeting the molecular events contributing to disease.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To examine the features of myopia-related optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in a population-based setting.\n",
      "DESIGN: Population-based study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: The Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 subjects with an age of 50 years or more.\n",
      "METHODS: The participants underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination including OCT with enhanced depth imaging of the macula.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Optical coherence tomography features of the macula in highly myopic eyes defined by a refractive error of -6 diopters or less or an axial length of 26.5 mm or more.\n",
      "RESULTS: Readable OCT images were available for 6530 eyes (94.5%) of 3278 participants. The most common change in the macula was maculoschisis (0.8±0.1%), followed by incomplete posterior vitreous detachment (0.7±0.1%), disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment interface (0.6±0.1%), epiretinal membranes (0.6±0.1%), macular defects in Bruch's membrane (0.3±0.1%), clumping of the retinal pigment epithelium (0.2±0.1%), vitreofoveal adhesion (0.2±0.1%), and macular holes in 2 eyes (0.1±0.1%). Prevalence of any myopic maculopathy per eye was 112 of 6530, or 1.71±0.16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-2.03). After adjustment for longer axial length (P<0.001; odds ratio [OR], 2.68; 95% CI, 1.97-3.64) and myopic refractive error (P<0.001; OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.73), presence of any myopic maculopathy was not significantly associated with any systemic variables (all P≥0.05), including biochemical blood examination and ocular parameters. Best-corrected visual acuity was associated significantly with the absence of a disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment interface (P<0.001), epiretinal membranes (P<0.001), and macular holes (P<0.001) after adjustment for age and cylindrical refractive error.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Based on OCT examination, the most common macular change in highly myopic eyes was maculoschisis, followed by incomplete posterior vitreous detachment, disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment interface, epiretinal membranes, macular defects in Bruch's membrane, clumping of the retinal pigment epithelium, vitreofoveal adhesion, and macular holes. The most important macular changes with a negative effect on best-corrected visual acuity were a disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment interface and epiretinal membranes.\n"

      " Evaluating the association between pathological myopia and SNPs in RASGRF1. ACTC1 and GJD2 genes at chromosome 15q14 and 15q25 in a Chinese population.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the association of the 27 SNPs located in RASGRF1. GJD2, and ACTC1 genes with pathological myopia in a Chinese Han population.\n",
      "METHODS: Myopia patients were stratified according to whether they did (n = 274) or did not (n = 131) have myopic macular degeneration (MMD). The SNPbrowser software was used to identify specific SNPs for analysis and minimal allele frequency of >20%, and a pairwise r(2) < 0.85 were genotyped using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.\n",
      "RESULTS: Before controlling for false discovery rate, the frequency of the rs1867315 C/C genotype compared with healthy controls was lower in the myopia group (p = 0.006) and in myopia patients without macular degeneration (p = 0.019). The frequency of the rs670957A/A genotype was also lower in patients without MMD compared with controls (p = 0.045). For rs2070664, the frequency of the A allele was higher in the patients with MMD compared to those without MMD (p = 0.032). After controlling for a false discovery rate of 5%, there was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between these groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In this study, there was no association of the analyzed SNPs located in RASGRF1. GJD2, and ACTC1 with pathological myopia, suggesting that SNPs included in our study have no or a limited role in causing pathologic myopia in this Chinese Han population.\n"

      "AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of a registration system for the blind people and to monitor the blindness due to uncorrected refractive error and cataract in Jing'an district, Shanghai, China.\n",
      "METHODS: Five hundred and ten blind people, based on visual acuity screening in a population aged 70 or older were enrolled into the study. Four hundred and forty subjects were interviewed. The following data were collected on each patient: demographic data, number of hospital visits for eye related problems, distance visual acuity, visual fields, ophthalmic diagnoses, education and registration status. If the eligible subject was not registered as blind, the reason for non-registration was recorded.\n",
      "RESULTS: Ten point nine one percent blindness was due to cataract, 27.5% due to uncorrected refractive error, and only 61.59% met the eligible blindness criteria (uncorrected refractive error and cataract are not considered as eligible blindness). The first four leading causes of eligible blindness were age related macular degeneration (25.09%), myopic macular degeneration (21.40%), glaucoma (18.82%) and corneal disease (8.12%). Only 68.27% eligible blind people were registered. The patients with macular degeneration and glaucoma tended not to register. Blind people with an above primary school education were 2.59 times more likely to be registered than those who were illiterate or had only a primary school education (OR=2.59, 95%CI: 1.49-4.48, P<0.01). Patients who had 4 or more visits to the hospital requesting eye care services in a year were 2.2 times more likely to be registered than those with less than 4 visits to the hospital (OR=2.54, 95%CI: 1.47-4.38, P<0.001). The first two leading reasons of misregistration were unknowing the registration system (48%) and unwilling to register (21%).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Under-registration of the eligible blind people exists in the registry system. Education and the number of hospital visits for eye care services were factors associated with registration levels. Uncorrected refractive error and cataract are important causes of blindness.\n",

      " Identification of a novel mutation in the PRCD gene causing autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in a Turkish family.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD) is a canine form of autosomal recessive photoreceptor degeneration and serves as an animal model for human retinitis pigmentosa (RP). To date, only two RP-causing mutations of the PRCD gene have been reported in humans. We found a novel mutation in PRCD (c.52C>T, p.R18X) in three siblings affected by RP and present detailed morphologic and functional parameters.\n",
      "METHODS: A complete ophthalmological examination was performed including psychophysical tests (best-corrected visual acuity, Lanthony Panel D-15 color vision test, and visual field) and electrophysiology (ganzfeld and multifocal electroretinogram). Additionally, color and infrared fundus photography, autofluorescence, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography recordings were performed. Genomic DNA of the three affected individuals was analyzed with high-throughput sequencing for all RP-related genes in a diagnostic set-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: We identified a novel homozygous mutation in PRCD (c.52C>T, p.R18X) with diagnostic high-throughput panel sequencing. All three patients showed an advanced stage of retinitis pigmentosa with reduced visual acuity (mean: 20/80), small residual visual fields (mean for target III4e: 1134.35 deg²), and non-detectable electrophysiological responses. Myopia, posterior subcapsular cataract, bone spicule-like pigmentation, and attenuated arterioles were typical findings. Interestingly, bull's eye maculopathy due to patchy retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was also present in all patients. The mean central retinal thickness observed in optical coherence tomography was 148 µm.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a third mutation in PRCD confirms its role in the pathogenesis of RP. Clinical findings were in line with the morphological changes observed in previous studies. Bull's eye maculopathy seems to be a hallmark of RP due to mutations in the PRCD gene.\n"

Subfoveal choroidal thickness showed no significant differences between groups (p>0.05). Positive correlation was found between BCVA and macular choroidal thickness (r = +0.293, p<0.001). Regression analysis showed that age (p<0.001), axial length (p<0.001), sex (p = 0.001), and myopic lesions such as tessellated fundus (p = 0.046) and patchy atrophy (p = 0.008) were predictive of choroidal thickness. Type of treatment was not predictive of choroidal thickness.\n",

Eyes with any clinical evidence of maculopathy or amblyopia were excluded. Eyes were imaged using the 3D-2000 OCT (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Two independent investigators manually measured: choroidal thickness at 500-μm intervals up to 2500-μm nasal and temporal to the fovea, subfoveal choroidal thickness, foveal thickness, outer nuclear layer and photoreceptors in addition to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Statistical analysis was performed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean age was 45.9±17.9 years (range 18-99), mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) LogMAR was 0.11±0.19 (range 0-1), mean axial length was 28.2±2.4 mm (range 26-35.3) and mean spherical equivalent was -12.05±5.02 D (range -6 to -26).

      " [Choroidal neovascularisation in pathological myopia: epidemiological data from a health services research study conducted in Germany].\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Pathological myopia (PM) or high myopia is defined as excessive short-sightedness (more than -6 dioptres) caused by a strong dilation of the bulbus oculi, that can induce the development of new and unstable vessel structures [choroidal neovascularisation (CNV)]. Since there are only limited epidemiological data available on PM, this health services research study was conducted.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: A health services survey with ophthalmologists throughout Germany was undertaken. Physicians were asked to complete a 51-item questionnaire on CNV in PM as well as on its early stages in their daily practice, diagnosis, control and treatment, patient numbers and evaluation of health care situation. Statistical analyses were entirely descriptive.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 7,500 ophthalmologists, a representative sample of 800 was randomly selected; 340 physicians took part. The mean prevalence rates/year/practice were 1,765.5 ± 1,218.1 with myopia, 230.7 ± 278.6 patients with high myopia, subdivided into 129.3 ± 242.8 patients with PM without macular degeneration (MD), 39.6 ± 64.8 patients with PM and MD, and 13.3 ± 30.3 patients with PM and CNV. Data on diagnosis and control show a lack of clearly defined standardisation. With regard to treatment of CNV in PM the data show the current discrepancy of guideline recommendations and approved treatment options.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The prevalence and incidence data collected in this study vary considerably between physicians. This may be explained by the various grades of specialisation as well as to possibly existing uncertainties regarding the definition and nomenclature of PM/high myopia and their different stages of the disease that should be harmonised. A generally accepted definition of severity grades, recommendations on diagnosis as well as detailed information and continuous training programmes on this disease is necessary.\n"

      " Mutations in SCO2 are associated with autosomal-dominant high-grade myopia.\n",
      "Myopia, or near-sightedness, is an ocular refractive error of unfocused image quality in front of the retinal plane. Individuals with high-grade myopia (dioptric power greater than -6.00) are predisposed to ocular morbidities such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, and myopic maculopathy. Nonsyndromic, high-grade myopia is highly heritable, and to date multiple gene loci have been reported. We performed exome sequencing in 4 individuals from an 11-member family of European descent from the United States. Affected individuals had a mean dioptric spherical equivalent of -22.00 sphere. A premature stop codon mutation c.157C>T (p.Gln53*) cosegregating with disease was discovered within SCO2 that maps to chromosome 22q13.33. Subsequent analyses identified three additional mutations in three highly myopic unrelated individuals (c.341G>A, c.418G>A, and c.776C>T). To determine differential gene expression in a developmental mouse model, we induced myopia by applying a -15.00D lens over one eye. Messenger RNA levels of SCO2 were significantly downregulated in myopic mouse retinae. Immunohistochemistry in mouse eyes confirmed SCO2 protein localization in retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and sclera. SCO2 encodes for a copper homeostasis protein influential in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity. Copper deficiencies have been linked with photoreceptor loss and myopia with increased scleral wall elasticity. Retinal thinning has been reported with an SC02 variant. Human mutation identification with support from an induced myopic animal provides biological insights of myopic development.\n"

      " Noninvasive investigation of deep vascular pathologies of exudative macular diseases by high-penetration optical coherence angiography.\n",
      "PURPOSE: A newly developed high-penetration Doppler optical coherence angiography (HP-OCA) with a 1-μm probe beam for noninvasive investigation of vascular pathology of exudative macular diseases is introduced. A descriptive case series is presented to discuss the clinical utility of HP-OCA.\n",
      "METHODS: Eleven eyes of 10 subjects with exudative macular disease, including two eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV); four eyes with AMD; and five eyes with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) were investigated. Two Doppler scanning modes (bidirectional and high-sensitive) of HP-OCA were used for the investigation. HP-OCA provides depth-resolved and en face angiograms and a structural OCT noninvasively. The HP-OCA images were compared with fluorescein angiography (FA); indocyanine green angiography (ICGA); and color fundus images.\n",
      "RESULTS: The abnormal vasculature patterns observed with high-sensitive HP-OCA presented high similarity to the midphase of ICGA. Several abnormal Doppler signals were observed in the en face high-sensitive HP-OCA and were colocated with FA leakage. This colocation was found in one eye with mCNV, four eyes with AMD, and one eye with PCV. Doppler tomogram of the bidirectional mode showed abnormal Doppler signals in three of five PCV cases beneath the pigment epithelium detachment. With the high-sensitive mode, Doppler signals were found beneath the elevated retinal pigment epithelium in all untreated cases.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: HP-OCA revealed depth-resolved abnormal vasculatures in exudative macular diseases. The en face HP-OCA images showed high similarity with FA and ICGA images. These results suggest HP-OCA can be used for noninvasive and three-dimensional angiography in a clinical routine.\n"

      " Three years follow-up results of ranibizumab treatment for choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathological myopia (PM) is one of the main causes of severe visual impairment in patients younger than 50 years. In this analysis we want to demonstrate the long-term results of Ranibizumab treating CNV secondary to PM.\n",
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 15 treatment naive eyes of 13 patients (10 women, 3 men, mean age: 61.5, SD 11.6, range: 41-80) with visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM, which were treated with ranibizumab. Criteria for re-treatment were reduction of visual acuity and/or activity in OCT or fluorescence angiography.\n",
      "RESULTS: We applied a mean of 3 injections (standard deviation [SD] 2.5, range: 1-8) ranibizumab during a mean period of 39.6 months (SD 5.3, range: 31-52). The spherical equivalent was -12.4 diopters ± 4.1 (range -7.5 to -20.5 diopters). Before the first injection mean visual acuity (logMAR) was 0.69 ± 0.26. After one month visual acuity improved to 0.39 ± 0.23 (p = 0.002), after 3 months to 0.30 ± 0.22 (p = 0.002) and after 6 months up to 0.30 ± 0.22 (p = 0.002). After 12 months visual acuity was 0.30 ± 0.22 (p = 0.001) and after 24 months 0.30 ± SD 0.24 (p = 0.001). 11 patients reached a follow-up of at least 36 months and visual acuity was 0.30 ± 0.13 (p = 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Treating CNV secondary to PM with ranibizumab during a follow-up of 36 months, we found considerable improvement of visual acuity. Compared to treatment of CNV secondary to exudative age-related macular degeneration, CNVs secondary to PM seem to respond faster to ranibizumab treatment and less injections are neccessary to reach stabilization.\n"

      " Supra choroidal buckling in managing myopic vitreoretinal interface disorders: 1-year data.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of supra choroidal buckling procedure using a supra choroidal catheter, as a new approach in treating myopic vitreomacular interface disorders specially in difficult cases of myopic traction maculopathy with or without macular hole retinal detachment in posterior staphyloma depending on the concept of indenting the choroid only, from a 1-year data study.\n",
      "METHODS: A newly developed supra choroidal catheter was used to deliver stabilized, cross-linked, long-acting hyaluronic acid as a filler in the supra choroidal space in the area of the staphyloma forming a choroidal indenting effect. Before the injection, pars plana vitrectomy was performed without internal limiting membrane peeling to avoid the risk of break of the roof of foveal detachment in case of foveoschisis. This indentation was used to treat 11 patients with myopic foveoschisis and 12 patients with myopic macular hole retinal detachment, 5 of whom had failed primary repair by vitrectomy before inclusion in this trial. Clinical and optical coherence tomographic evaluations of these patients were performed over 1-year follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: Retinal layer restoration was achieved in all 11 eyes with myopic foveoschisis. This was gradual over a period of 2 to 6 weeks postoperatively. No recurrence over the 12-month follow-up was observed. Visual acuity improved by 1 line or more in 9 eyes (81.8%). Of the 12 eyes, 10 with macular hole detachment (83%) showed closure of the holes in association with the resolution of the detachment; 2 eyes showed resolution of the detachment and flatting of the edge of the holes but with incomplete closure on optical coherence tomography. Eight eyes (66.6%) showed improvement in visual acuity by 1 or more lines with no recurrence of retinal detachment over the 12-month follow-up period. The indentation effect was sufficient over the 12-month follow-up period.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The indentation effect achieved by supra choroidal approach can be used as a method of managing myopic foveoschisis and myopic macular hole with detachment even in eyes with failed primary vitrectomy, counteracting the role of posterior staphyloma in the role of the disease. The indentation effect is sufficient for first year of follow-up.\n",

      " Exome sequencing reveals CCDC111 mutation associated with high myopia.\n",
      "Myopia is a refractive error of the eye that is prevalent worldwide. The most extreme form, high myopia, is usually associated with other ocular disorders such as retinal detachment, macular degeneration, cataract, and glaucoma, and is one of leading causes of blindness. The etiology is complex and has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified a novel missense variant of the CCDC111 gene (NM_152683.2: c.265T > G; p.Y89D) in a high myopia family by exome sequencing. The variant was identified in 4 patients from an additional 270 sporadic high myopia patients, but not found in 270 controls. The amino acid is highly conserved across species, and variants giving rise to amino acid substitutions are predicted to be functionally damaging. The CCDC111 gene was ubiquitously expressed in primary cell cultures from human eye tissue, including corneal epithelial cells, choroidal melanoma cells, scleral fibroblasts, retinal epithelial cells, retinal Müller cells, and lens capsule epithelial cells. In summary, our results suggested that the CCDC111 may be a susceptibility gene for high myopia.\n"

      " Sensitivity of fluorescein angiography alone or with SD-OCT for the diagnosis of myopic choroidal neovascularization.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) has certain characteristics and features that distinguish it from choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration. There may be angiographic diagnostic difficulties even when using the scanning laser ophthalmoscope, which gives more contrast and better definition than traditional angiography. The aim of the study is to compare the sensitivity of fluorescein angiography (FA) alone or combined with Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) for assessing the incidence of mCNV.\n",
      "METHODS: In this retrospective study, two authors reviewed the charts and images of patients with recent (<30 days) vision deterioration, pathologic myopia, axial length >26 mm, documentation or suspicion of mCNV or macular exudative pathologies at FA and OCT. They only examined the images at first presentation obtained by the multi-modal imaging system that combines Infrared reflectance, FA, and SD-OCT, (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany). The images selected were then evaluated by three other investigators in blinded, independent conditions, in order to make their diagnosis, which was noted or rated as doubtful if it could not be decided on the basis of FA alone. SD-OCT images were then shown and compared to IR and FA by each of the three investigators individually to formulate a conclusive diagnosis.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 71 eyes of 69 patients were suitable for the study, mean age 65.97±14.57 years, spherical equivalent refraction -8.82 ± 2.51 diopters. Concordance between the three examiners' interpretations of FA features and FA-guided SD-OCT was 50/71 (70.4 %) and 67/71 (94 %) respectively. Total agreement on diagnosis between the three examiners was achieved in 55 % of cases for FA (κ = 0.53, p < 0.001), and 94 % for FA-guided SD-OCT (k = -0.01, p = 0.5). The final diagnosis with FA and FA-guided SD-OCT differed in 29 cases (40 %; 95 % C.I. 29-42 %), whereas 12 (17 %) mCNV were overlooked at FA, and in 11 (15 %) cases none of the examiners reached a diagnosis based on FA alone.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of FA alone, active mCNV can be misdiagnosed. The use of SD-OCT combined with FA should therefore be strongly considered.\n",

      " Angiographic and optical coherence tomography characteristics of recent myopic choroidal neovascularization.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To analyze the contribution of fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) to the diagnosis of recent choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with high myopia.\n",
      "DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.\n",
      "METHODS: Ninety eyes of 73 highly myopic patients (refractive error ≥-6 diopters) with CNV in 1 or both eyes were included. Epidemiologic features, refractive error, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and SD OCT findings at onset of CNV were analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Mean age at onset of CNV was 54.4 ± 14 years. CNV was bilateral in 17 of 73 cases. Mean refractive error was -13.9 ± 5.2 diopters. Myopic CNV was associated more frequently with patchy or geographic atrophy (P = .019). CNV was associated with exudative features on fluorescein angiography in 82% of cases (64/78), and on SD OCT in 48.6% of cases (36/74). There was no agreement about signs of active CNV between these 2 imaging methods (κ = 25.7 ± 10%; P = .0044). CNV area was significantly smaller in younger patients (<55 years) than in older patients (0.57 mm(2) vs 1.21 mm(2), respectively; P = .023).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Exudative features of myopic CNV are more obvious on FA than on SD OCT, suggesting that fluorescein angiography should be performed when new-onset myopic CNV is suspected. Myopic CNV occurring in older patients (≥55 years) is larger than those seen in younger patients and resembles CNV associated with age-related macular degeneration. This suggests an overlap between myopic CNV in older patients and age-related macular degeneration.\n"

      "OBJECTIVES: Validation of choroidal thickness and other biometrics measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in predicting lacquer cracks formation in highly myopic eyes.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients with a refractive error worse than -8 diopters and moderate myopic maculopathy were recruited into two groups based on the presence or absence of lacquer cracks (36 eyes without and 33 eyes with lacquer cracks). Choroidal thickness, refractive error, and axial length were measured and subjected to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to identify the optimal cutoff values at predicting lacquer crack formation. The width of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), RPE to the inner segment/outer segment line, RPE to the external limiting membrane were also measured and compared to the subfoveal choroidal thickness to assess their relationships as potential markers of lacquer crack formation.\n",
      "RESULTS: Lacquer crack is associated with decreased choroidal thickness, lower best-corrected visual acuity, longer axial length and higher refractive errors. Choroidal thickness has the strongest association with lacquer crack formation versus axial length and refractive error. In eyes with lacquer cracks, stellate lacquer cracks are associated with thinner choroidal thickness compared to eyes with linear lacquer cracks. Subfoveal choroidal thickness less than the width of the retinal pigment epithelium to the inner segment/outer segment line is also associated with lacquer crack formation (sensitivity 78.8%, specificity 88.3%, and accuracy 81.2%).\n",

      " Ocular neovascularization.\n",
      "Retinal and choroidal vascular diseases constitute the most common causes of moderate and severe vision loss in developed countries. They can be divided into retinal vascular diseases, in which there is leakage and/or neovascularization (NV) from retinal vessels, and subretinal NV, in which new vessels grow into the normally avascular outer retina and subretinal space. The first category of diseases includes diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, and retinopathy of prematurity, and the second category includes neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), ocular histoplasmosis, pathologic myopia, and other related diseases. Retinal hypoxia is a key feature of the first category of diseases resulting in elevated levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) which stimulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), placental growth factor, stromal-derived growth factor-1 and their receptors, as well as other hypoxia-regulated gene products such as angiopoietin-2. Although hypoxia has not been demonstrated as part of the second category of diseases, HIF-1 is elevated and thus the same group of hypoxia-regulated gene products plays a role. Clinical trials have shown that VEGF antagonists provide major benefits for patients with subretinal NV due to AMD and even greater benefits are seen by combining antagonists of VEGF and PDGF-B. It is likely that addition of antagonists of other agents listed above will be tested in the future. Other appealing strategies are to directly target HIF-1 or to use gene transfer to express endogenous or engineered anti-angiogenic proteins. While substantial progress has been made, the future looks even brighter for patients with retinal and choroidal vascular diseases.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To investigate a possible relationship between refractive error and cognitive function.\n",
      "METHODS: This population-based, cross-sectional study included 1032 persons aged 60 to 79 who participated in the Singapore Malay Eye Study. Refraction (sphere, cylinder, and axis) was measured using an autorefractor, and spherical equivalent was defined as sphere plus half negative cylinder. Refractive errors were defined as myopia (spherical equivalent < -0.5), emmetropia (-0.5 diopter [D] ≤ spherical equivalent ≤ 0.5 D), and hyperopia (spherical equivalent > 0.5 D). Visual acuity was measured with a logMAR chart. Cognitive dysfunction, assessed using the Abbreviated Mental Test, was defined based on education-specific cutoff values.\n",
      "RESULTS: Compared with individuals with emmetropia, persons with myopia were almost twice as likely to have cognitive dysfunction (odds ratio 1.82; 95% confidence interval 1.05-3.15), after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, income, education, and hours of reading and writing per day. Hyperopia was not associated with cognitive dysfunction. The association remained significant after further adjustment for uncorrected refractive errors or best-corrected visual acuity.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of biofeedback treatment for low-vision rehabilitation in patients affected by macular disease.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: 171 eyes of 99 patients (42 female and 57 male) between 50 to 75 years old (mean age: 64.6) were included in this study. All patients were suffering from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (122 eyes) or macular myopic degeneration (MMD) (49 eyes). All patients underwent an assessment of examinations including visual acuity, reading speed test, slit lamp examination and tonometry, ophthalmoscopic fundus examination, microperimetry, fixation test, retinal sensitivity, fluorangiography (FAG), optical coherence tomography (OCT). The treatment was divided in 16 sessions, the patients underwent other examination assessment at 6 and 12 months, except for FAG and OCT. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, and p-value <=0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "RESULTS: After training 130 eyes of 171 in the study group (76.02%) had a statistically significant improvement of the distant visual acuity (p<0.01): 38 eyes suffering from MMD and 92 eyes suffering from AMD. After 12 months of follow-up a group of 25 eyes of 130 (19.23%) had a loss of benefits that were observed at the end of the treatment sessions: 16 eyes and 9 eyes were suffering from MMD and AMD respectively. Examination assessment during follow-up showed that 4 eyes and 2 eyes of the group that lost benefits had a worsening of MMD and AMD primary disease respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: It is not yet understood how biofeedback produces amelioration of visual function. According to the 'Eccentric fixation' theory, with biofeedback rehabilitation patients are trained to use the non-damaged retina areas to develop a new preferred retinal locus. In our study group we found a significant improvement in both visual acuity and fixation.\n"

      "METHODS: This study was designed as a retrospective, interventional case series, for which the inclusion criteria were pathologic myopia, and documentation of untreated active macular CNV on fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography. Monthly changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual gain after each treatment, and correlation with refraction, age, location, and dimension of CNV were considered. The data were analyzed using the one-tailed, paired Wilcoxon test.\n",
      "RESULTS: Nineteen naive eyes were found suitable for the study. The mean number of treatments was 3.32 ± 2.36 (confidence interval 2.25-4.37) during a mean follow-up period of 18.95 ± 8.3 months. At baseline, mean BCVA was 0.58 ± 0.37 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units. At 12 months, mean BCVA was 0.39 ± 0.35 logMAR and at 24 months was 0.39 ± 0.40. Mean improvement in BCVA from baseline was +0.17 ± 0.25 logMAR (P < 0.05) at month 12, +0.14 ± 0.25 logMAR (P = 0.1) at month 18, and +0.09 ± 0.32 logMAR (P = 0.5) at month 24.

      "METHODS: Refractive error was determined by subjective refraction, and AL was determined by noncontact partial coherence laser interferometry. Age-related macular degeneration and DR were defined from retinal photographs according to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System and Airlie House classification system, respectively. Age-related cataract was diagnosed clinically using the Lens Opacity Classification System (LOCS) III system.

      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-related macular degeneration, DR, age-related cataract, and POAG.\n",
      "RESULTS: Myopic eyes (spherical equivalent [SE] <-0.5 diopter [D]) were less likely to have AMD (early plus late AMD) (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.79) or DR (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-0.98) compared with emmetropic eyes; each millimeter increase in AL was associated with a lower prevalence of AMD (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89) and DR (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86). Myopic eyes were more likely to have nuclear (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13-2.20) and posterior subcapsular (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.10-2.72) cataract, but not cortical cataract (P = 0.64); each millimeter increase in AL was associated with a higher prevalence of posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07-1.55), but not nuclear (P = 0.77) or cortical (P = 0.39) cataract.

      "PATIENT: A 22-year-old American female, after taking 100 mg of topiramate (Topamax®) a day for 6 days because of a migraine attack, complained of severe visual acuity deterioration of sudden onset in both eyes, regardless of distance (far or near), during the span of 1 day. A complete ocular examination was carried out. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the right eye was hand motion and in the left eye was counting fingers. Cycloplegic refraction and pinhole did not improve the visual acuity of patient's eyes. The anterior chamber depth was normal in both eyes. Tonometry was 14 mmHg in both eyes. Fundus biomicroscopy disclosed a maculopathy with macular striae and a cellophane-like reflex.

Reproducible measurements of intraretinal and subretinal fluid are of growing importance for an evaluation of progression. The non-invasive technique reduces the need for frequent fluorescence angiography after individual assessment. Appropriate correction of the reference arm is mandatory. Automatic adjustment of transversal measured values due to alterations in the paraxial field (depending on the axial length) has been implemented in a new device.

      "Choroidal neovascularization due to pathological myopia (mCNV) differs in important characteristics from lesions seen in age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Myopic CNV is associated with typical phenomena, such as lacquer cracks or patchy atrophy drusen or pigment epithelium detachment are rare occurrences. The dimensions of mCNV and the extent of leakage are substantially smaller. The heterogeneous combination of thinning and concomitant staphyloma often complicates the early detection of neovascular lesions. Diagnosis and evaluation of the clinical progress are only possible using the combination of different imaging modalities, e.g. funduscopy, fluorescein angiography (FLA) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Special forms, such as periconal mCNV or dome-shaped variants exhibit a typical progression and response to therapy. In the course of the disease a progressive pigmentation and secondary atrophy occur and later, depigmentation of the mCNV complicates the demarcation of the original mCNV within the zone of atrophy. Extensive information and counselling seem to be mandatory in order to allow a better self-assessment. Sometimes, patients notice the first symptoms of recurrent mCNV activity before confirmation is possible by objective diagnostics.\n"

      "METHODS: Forty-five eyes of 45 consecutive patients who underwent vitrectomy and ILM peeling for the treatment of a foveal RD attributable to myopic traction maculopathy were studied. The patients were divided into 2 groups by the area of ILM peeled: complete macular ILM peeled group (30 eyes) and fovea-sparing ILM peeled group (15 eyes). A gas tamponade was used in all of the eyes. The main outcome measures were the rate of development of a full-thickness macular hole (MH) and the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

      "RESULTS: A full-thickness MH developed in 5 of 30 eyes (16.7%) in the complete ILM peeled group and in none of the 15 eyes in the fovea-sparing ILM peeled group.

      " The complex interactions of retinal, optical and environmental factors in myopia aetiology.\n",
      "Myopia is the commonest ocular abnormality but as a research topic remains at the margins of mainstream ophthalmology. The concept that most myopes fall into the category of 'physiological myopia' undoubtedly contributes to this position. Yet detailed analysis of epidemiological data linking myopia with a range of ocular pathologies from glaucoma to retinal detachment demonstrates statistically significant disease association in the 0 to -6 D range of 'physiological myopia'. The calculated risks from myopia are comparable to those between hypertension, smoking and cardiovascular disease. In the case of myopic maculopathy and retinal detachment the risks are an order of magnitude greater. This finding highlights the potential benefits of interventions that can limit or prevent myopia progression. Our understanding of the regulatory processes that guide an eye to emmetropia and, conversely how the failure of such mechanisms can lead to refractive errors, is certainly incomplete but has grown enormously in the last few decades. Animal studies, observational clinical studies and more recently randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the retinal image can influence the eye's growth. To date human intervention trials in myopia progression using optical means have had limited success but have been designed on the basis of simple hypotheses regarding the amount of defocus at the fovea. Recent animal studies, backed by observational clinical studies, have revealed that the mechanisms of optically guided eye growth are influenced by the retinal image across a wide area of the retina and not solely the fovea. Such results necessitate a fundamental shift in how refractive errors are defined. In the context of understanding eye growth a single sphero-cylindrical definition of foveal refraction is insufficient. Instead refractive error must be considered across the curved surface of the retina. This carries the consequence that local retinal image defocus can only be determined once the 3D structure of the viewed scene, off axis performance of the eye and eye shape has been accurately defined. This, in turn, introduces an under-appreciated level of complexity and interaction between the environment, ocular optics and eye shape that needs to be considered when planning and interpreting the results of clinical trials on myopia prevention.\n"

Nevertheless, it is still mandatory to define the remaining applications, role, and potential of verteporfin in ocular photodynamic therapy (PDT), including the dosages of administration, effectiveness, and safety profile.\n",
      "AREAS COVERED: Although verteporfin PDT has forfeited the first-line status and value of treating subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration or pathologic myopia, the treatment remains the standard of care for choroidal haemangioma and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. PDT is effective in less pigmented choroidal melanoma as well as in retinal vascular proliferations and retinal angioma. Verteporfin was granted the orphan drug designation for the treatment of chronic or recurrent central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).\n",
      "EXPERT OPINION: Evidence-based data regarding optimized parameters (low fluence, reduced dose, fractionated irradiation) adapted to the treated diseases (target structure, dosimetry, blood supply) are scarce. Prospective and large clinical trials are missing, although the scientific community agrees on the fact that the standard treatment protocol does not necessarily provide the optimal efficacy to the specific disease or individual patient. Within the reviewed indications, the adverse effect profile is favorable compared with other therapies.\n"

      " Prevalence and associated risk factors of myopic maculopathy in elderly Chinese: the Shihpai eye study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and associated risk factors of myopic maculopathy in an elderly Chinese population in Taiwan.\n",
      "METHODS: Population-based, cross-sectional study. A total of 1361 Chinese aged 65 years or older residing in Shihpai, Taipei, Taiwan, underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination. Of the 1361 participants, 1058 subjects had at least one gradable fundus photograph and were recruited for analysis. High myopia was defined as spherical equivalent of less than -6.0 diopter (D) in the phakic eyes or axial length greater than 26.5 mm in pseudophakic or aphakic eyes. Myopic maculopathy was defined as the appearance of lacquer cracks, focal area of deep choroidal atrophy and macular choroidal neovascularization, or geographic atrophy in the presence of high myopia.\n",
      "RESULTS: The prevalence of high myopia was 4.2% (44/1058). Signs of myopic maculopathy were present in 32 (72.7%) of the 44 high myopics, representing a prevalence of 3.0% (95% confidence interval, 2.0%-4.0%). Subjects with high myopia with myopic maculopathy had higher systolic blood pressure than those without maculopathy (146.4 ± 16.2 mm Hg vs. 127.0 ± 15.9 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and the difference persisted (P = 0.018) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, educational levels, alcohol drinking, and histories of diabetes or taking anti-hypertension medication. Of the 65 high myopic eyes, eyes with maculopathy had a greater myopic degree (-12.8 ± 5.1 D vs. -7.6 ± 1.5 D, P = 0.001) and poorer corrected visual acuity (logMAR 0.72 ± 0.6 vs. 0.27 ± 0.2, P = 0.001) than those without.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of high myopia and myopic maculopathy in this elderly Chinese population group was high. Of the major risk factors examined, high systolic blood pressure may be associated with myopic maculopathy.\n",

      "Combined use of OCT and ERG allowed us to study correlation of functional changes and morphological retinal features in patients with congenital myopia with or without myopic maculopathy. The study revealed the following features of retinal contour in macula region in congenital myopia compared to emmetropia: increase of neuroepithelial thickness in fovea centre, trend to decrease of its thickness in perifoveolar zone, significant (1,7-fold) reduction of neuroepithelial thickness difference between central and pericentral zones and subsequently change of retinal profile. Revealed data should be considered in retinal thickness evaluation of adults with high myopia and in assessment of normal postnatal macula development in children with high myopia. Combination of ophthalmoscopy, OCT and m-ERG may help in early diagnosis and monitoring of progressing macula changes.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To study changes in choroidal thickness with ranibizumab treatment for choroidal neovascularization (CNV).\n",
      "DESIGN: Prospective case series.\n",
      "METHODS: This prospective study consisted of 60 CNV-affected eyes of 60 patients treated with intravitreal injections of ranibizumab using an on-demand protocol after an initial loading phase. The eyes studied included 20 with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 20 with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and 20 with myopic CNV. In the eyes with AMD and PCV, choroidal thickness at the fovea was measured with optical coherence tomography using enhanced depth imaging. In eyes with myopic CNV, the choroidal thickness was measured using standard optical coherence tomography without the enhanced depth imaging technique.\n",
      "RESULTS: With ranibizumab treatment, central retinal thickness decreased significantly (P < 0.001) and visual acuity improved significantly (P < 0.001). However, central choroidal thickness (167.2 ± 108.3 μm) showed no significant change at 1 month after the loading phase (165.2 ± 107.8 μm, P = 0.120) or at final examination (164.8 ± 107.7 μm, P = 0.115). At baseline, central retinal thickness in eyes with AMD was significantly greater that those with PCV (P = 0.005) or high myopia (P = 0.029). However, central choroidal thickness in eyes with myopic CNV was significantly thinner than in eyes with AMD (P < 0.001) or PCV (P < 0.001). In each type of disease, there was no significant change in central choroidal thickness with ranibizumab treatment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The effect of ranibizumab on the choroidal thickness is minimal, if any.\n"

      " Genetic factors for choroidal neovascularization associated with high myopia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Nonsyndromic high myopia, defined by a refractive error greater than -6 diopters (D), is associated with an increased risk of macular choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a vision-threatening complication. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic factors associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are related to myopic CNV.\n",
      "METHODS: We conducted a case-control study, including 71 cases with myopic CNV and 196 myopic controls without CNV, from Creteil and Toulouse, France, and Boston, MA. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 15 genes reported to be related to AMD were selected for association testing in this study.\n",
      "RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the rs10033900 SNP located in CFI was associated with myopic CNV (P = 0.0011), and a SNP in APOE was also related (P = 0.041). After adjustment for age, sex, and degree of myopia, SNPs in three genes were significantly associated, including CFI (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.37, P = 0.0023), COL8A1 (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.98, P = 0.0076), and CFH (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.04). After correction for multiple testing, only CFI remained significantly related to high myopic CNV (P = 0.045).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We report the first genetic associations with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a high myopic Caucasian population. One SNP (rs10033900) in the CFI gene, which encodes a protein involved in the inflammatory pathway, was significantly associated with myopic CNV in multivariate analysis after correction for multiple testing. This SNP is a plausible biological marker associated with CNV outgrowth among high myopic patients. Results generate hypotheses about potential loci related to CNV in high myopia, and larger studies are needed to expand on these findings.\n"

      " Five year incidence of visual field loss in adult Chinese. The Beijing Eye Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To describe the cumulative 5 year incidence of visual field loss in adult Chinese in Greater Beijing.\n",
      "METHODS: The Beijing Eye Study 2006 included 3251 subjects (mean age 60.4±10.1 years) who had participated in the Beijing Eye Study 2001 and returned for re-examination. All participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination, including visual field test by frequency doubling threshold perimetry. An abnormal visual field was defined as reduced sensitivity in at least one test location. Incident visual field loss was defined as a change in visual field from normal at baseline to abnormal at follow-up.\n",
      "RESULTS: An incident visual field loss was detected in 273 eyes (4.3±0.5%)/235 subjects (7.3±0.5%). It was significantly associated with higher age (P = 0.001), higher intraocular pressure (P<0.001), and higher fasting blood glucose concentration (P = 0.019). Considering only eyes (n = 140) with a detected cause for visual field loss, the most frequent causes were cataract (68 (48.6%) eyes) followed by glaucoma (23 (16.4%) eyes), diabetic retinopathy (13 (9.3%) eyes), age-related macular degeneration (10 (7.1%) eyes), and myopic degenerative retinopathy (9 (6.4%) eyes). For 133 (48.7%) eyes with a visual field loss, the cause for the VFL remained unclear.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year incidence of visual field loss was 4.3±0.5% per eye or 7.3±0.5% per subject. It increased significantly with age, intraocular pressure, and fasting blood glucose level. Major causes for the incidence of visual field loss were cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.\n"

      "The posterior vitreous detachment consists in the separation between the posterior vitreal cortex and internal limiting membrane of the retina. This is the peak of the vitreal para-physiological age-related modifications. This problem occurs in 6% of normal people of age between 45 and 65 years and in 65% of individuals between 65 and 85 years. Several elements can be responsible for vitreous modifications, such as senility, myopia, aphakia, pseudophakia, diabetes, degeneration vitreous retinal hereditary, traumatisms, inflammation. A 75 year old male patient has come to our attention for a left eye cataract. He has undergone to a series of OCT: the first before surgery showed a perifoveal vitreous detachmen; the following ones until six months after surgery put in evidence the DPV progression accompanied by EMC, relating it with visual symptomatology. Therefore, OCT is a useful tool for a clinical analysis but also for the contribution to research concerning the pathogenesis of diseases due to vitreo-retinal modification.\n",

      " Study of a US cohort supports the role of ZNF644 and high-grade myopia susceptibility.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Myopia, or nearsightedness, is highly prevalent in Asian countries and is considered a serious public health issue globally. High-grade myopia can predispose individuals to myopic maculopathy, premature cataracts, retinal detachment, and glaucoma. A recent study implicated zinc finger protein 644 isoform 1 (ZNF644) variants with non-syndromic high-grade myopia in a Chinese-Asian population. Herein we focused on investigating the role for ZNF644 variants in high-grade myopia in a United States (US) cohort.\n",
      "METHODS: DNA from a case cohort of 131 subject participants diagnosed with high-grade myopia was screened for ZNF644 variants. Spherical refractive error of -≤-6.00 diopters (D) in at least one eye was defined as affected. All coding, intron/exon boundaries were screened using Sanger sequencing. Single nucleotide allele frequencies were determined by screening 672 ethnically matched controls.\n",
      "RESULTS: Sequencing analysis did not detect previously reported mutations. However, our analysis identified 2 novel single nucleotide variants (c.725C>T, c.821A>T) in 2 high-grade myopia individuals- one Caucasian and one African American, respectively. These variants were not found in normal controls. A rare variant - dbsSNP132 (rs12117237→c.2119A>G) - with a minor allele frequency of 0.2% was present in 6 additional cases, but was also present in 5 controls.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified two novel variants in ZNF644 associated with high-grade myopia in a US cohort. Our results suggest that ZNF644 may play a role in myopia development.\n"

      " [Which abnormalities can be detected in myopic peripheral retina?].\n",
      "Vitreoretinal periphery in myopic eyes may present abnormalities whose frequency and severity are correlated with axial elongation of the eye: white-without-pressure, lattice degeneration, pigmentary degeneration, and paving stone degeneration. Sometimes one can find atrophic round holes, retinal breaks, or retinoschisis whose differential diagnosis with slow progressive retinal detachment can be made on the presence of an absolute field defect. The presence of peripheral vitreous strands, pigmentary migrations, holes, associated with extensive liquefaction of the central vitreous body and facial dysmorphy are symptomatic of Stickler syndrome often complicated with bilateral retinal detachments. Congenital hereditary retinoschisis should be raised in the presence of temporal and inferior bullous detachment of a thin inner layer of the retina associated with large multiple holes in a boy with poor vision and cystic macular changes. Examination of peripheral retina should be systematic after the age of 40 in myopic patients to specify the presence of abnormalities predisposing to retinal detachment. It is more important to inform the patient of posterior vitreous detachment or retinal detachment symptoms, a true emergency situation, rather than to suggest regular and repeated consultations in the nonsymptomatic eye.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of manual choroidal volume (CV) measurements by spectral domain- optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) using enhanced depth imaging (EDI).\n",
      "METHODS: Sixty eyes of 32 patients with or without any ocular chorioretinal diseases were enrolled prospectively. Thirty-one choroidal scans were performed on each eye, centered at the fovea, using a raster protocol. Two masked observers demarcated choroidal boundaries by using built-in automated retinal segmentation software on two separate sessions. Observers were masked to each other's and their own previous readings. A standardized grid centered on the fovea was positioned automatically by OCT software, and values for average CVs and total CVs in three concentric rings were noted. The agreement between the intraobserver measurements or interobserver measurements was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the clinically relevant magnitude of differences between inter- and intraobserver measurements.\n",
      "RESULTS: The interobserver CCC for the overall average CV was very high, 0.9956 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.991-0.9968). CCCs for all three Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study concentric rings between two graders was 0.98 to 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-0.98). Similarly intraobserver repeatability of two graders also ranged from 0.98 to 0.99. The interobserver coefficient of reproducibility was approximately 0.42 (95% CI, 0.34-0.5 mm(3)) for the average CV.\n",

      "METHODS: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p, and TNF-α in the aqueous humor samples of 17 patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), ten patients with pathological myopia (PM), seven patients with idiopathic choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and 14 patients with cataract and idiopathic epiretinal membrane or macular hole in the control group were measured with cytometric bead array. The maximum macular thickness and macular volume within 1 mm, 3 mm, and 6 mm were measured with OCT.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the CNV groups, the aqueous levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly associated with macular volume within 6 mm (p=0.011, p=0.008, respectively), while IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p, and TNF-α showed no significant correlation with either the maximum macular thickness or the macular volume. By further selecting patients with CNV who had accepted their last intravitreal injection of bevacizumab within 3 months, the level of IL-6 still significantly correlated with the maximum macular thickness (p=0.019) and macular volume within 1 mm (p=0.018), 3 mm (p=0.018), and 6 mm (p=0.022). In patients with exudative AMD, the level of IL-6 was significantly associated with the maximum macular thickness (p=0.025) and macular volume within 1 mm (p=0.025), 3 mm (p=0.006), and 6 mm (p=0.002). The aqueous level of all cytokines did not vary significantly between the CNV patients who had accepted their last intravitreal injection of bevacizumab within 3 months and the other patients, nor was a difference found among patients with exudative AMD, PM, and idiopathic CNV, and the control group.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Knobloch syndrome is defined as a triad of occipital defect, high myopia and vitreo-retinal degeneration (often with later retinal detachment); however, the ocular phenotype is not well defined. This report characterises eye findings of the syndrome in children with genetically confirmed disease.\n",
      "METHODS: Case series of Saudi children with previously documented homozygous mutations in COL18A1 or ADAMTS18.\n",
      "RESULTS: All eight children (4-15 years old; five families) had smooth (cryptless) irides, high myopia (-10 to -20 dioptres) and distinctive vitreo-retinal degeneration consisting of diffuse very severe retinal pigment epithelium atrophic changes with prominent choroidal vessel show, macular atrophic lesions with or without a 'punched out' appearance and white fibrillar vitreous condensations. In two probands and a sibling, this distinctive retinal appearance was the basis for initial clinical diagnosis. Six children had temporal ectopia lentis and four had posterior perinuclear lens opacity. Additional features included developmental delay (two), epilepsy (one) and heterotopic grey matter in the lateral ventricles (one). Four children had no clinically discernible occipital defect.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Taken together, smooth iridies, ectopia lentis and characteristic vitreo-retinal degeneration seem pathognomonic. Although it is a defining feature of the syndrome, clinically discernible occipital defect is not a sine qua non for the diagnosis.

      "OBJECTIVES: The verteporfin photodynamic therapy (VPDT) cohort study aimed to answer five questions: (a) is VPDT in the NHS provided as in randomised trials?; (b) is 'outcome' the same in the nhs as in randomised trials?; (c) is 'outcome' the same for patients ineligible for randomised trials?; (d) is VPDT safe when provided in the NHS?; and (e) how effective and cost-effective is VPDT?\n",
      "DESIGN: Treatment register.\n",
      "SETTING: All hospitals providing VPDT in the NHS.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: All patients attending VPDT clinics.\n",
      "INTERVENTIONS: Infusion of verteporfin followed by infrared laser exposure is called VPDT, and is used to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The VPDT cohort study advised clinicians to follow patients every 3 months during treatment or active observation, retreating based on criteria used in the previous commercial 'TAP' (Treatment of Age-related macular degeneration with Photodynamic therapy) trials of VPDT.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution monocular best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA). Secondary outcomes were adverse reactions and events; morphological changes in treated nAMD (wet) lesions; and for a subset of patients, 6-monthly contrast sensitivity, generic and visual health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and resource use. Treated eyes were classified as eligible for the TAP trials (EFT), ineligible (IFT) or unclassifiable (UNC).\n",
      "RESULTS: Forty-seven hospitals submitted data for 8323 treated eyes in 7748 patients; 4919 eyes in 4566 patients were treated more than 1 year before the last data submission or had completed treatment. Of 4043 eyes with nAMD in 4043 patients, 1227 were classified as EFT, 1187 as IFT and 1629 as UNC. HRQoL and resource use data were available for about 2000 patients. The mean number of treatments in years 1 and 2 was 2.3 and 0.4 respectively. About 50% of eyes completed treatment within 1 year. BCVA deterioration in year 1 did not differ between eligibility groups. EFT eyes lost 11.6 letters (95% confidence interval 10.1 to 13.0 letters) compared with 9.9 letters in VPDT-treated eyes in the TAP trials. EFT eyes had poorer BCVA at baseline than IFT and UNC eyes. Adverse reactions and events were reported for 1.4% of first visits - less frequently than those reported in the TAP trials. Associations between BCVA in the best-seeing eye with HRQoL and community health and social care resource use showed that the 11-letter difference in BCVA between VPDT and sham treatment in the TAP trials corresponded to differences in utility of 0.012 and health and social service costs of £60 and £92 in years 1 and 2, respectively. VPDT provided an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of £170,000 over 2 years.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: VPDT was administered less frequently than in the TAP trials, with less than half of those treated followed up for > 1 year in routine clinical practice. Deterioration in BCVA over time in EFT eyes was similar to that in the TAP trials. The similar falls in BCVA after VPDT across the pre-defined TAP eligibility groups do not mean that the treatment is equally effective in these groups because deterioration in BCVA can be influenced by the parameters that determined group membership. Safety was no worse than in the TAP trials. The estimated cost per QALY was similar to the highest previous estimate. Although VPDT is no longer in use as monotherapy for neovascular AMD, its role as adjunctive treatment has not been fully explored. VPDT also has potential as monotherapy in the management of vascular malformations of the retina and choroid and with trials underway in neovascularisation due to myopia and polypoidal choroidopathy.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To examine visual function after targeting -2.0 diopter (D) spherical equivalent (SE) when implanting a multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) in eyes with cataract and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n",
      "SETTING: Three private practices.\n",
      "DESIGN: Case series.\n",
      "METHODS: Lenses of cataractous eyes with AMD were replaced with the Acrysof Restor SN60D3 multifocal IOL, targeting an SE of -2.0 D, which yielded +5.2 D near addition. Near and distance visual acuities were examined. Patients completed a visual function questionnaire preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.\n",
      "RESULTS: At 6 months, 13 patients with 20 eligible eyes were examined. The uncorrected near visual acuity improved in 18 eyes (90%) and was unchanged in 2 eyes. The corrected distance visual acuity improved in 14 eyes (70%), was unchanged in 4 eyes (20%), and decreased (≤ 3 lines) in 2 eyes (10%). All vision-related questionnaire items improved.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: For cataractous eyes with AMD, replacing the crystalline lens with this myopia-targeted multifocal IOL improved or maintained near vision without severely compromising distance vision.\n",

      " Review of key findings from the Singapore Malay Eye Study (SiMES-1).\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: This study highlights the key epidemiological findings from the Singapore Malay Eye Study (SiMES-1).\n",
      "METHODS: SiMES-1 was a cross-sectional, population-based epidemiological study on eye diseases. It was performed on 3,280 randomly selected Malay adults living in the south-western part of Singapore. All study participants underwent various validated questionnaires and detailed eye examinations. A review of all papers published from SiMES-1 was performed.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 24.6% of the study population had myopia, while 35.3% had hyperopia and 39.4% had astigmatism. 20.4% of the population had under-corrected refractive error. 1,338 (45.7%) participants were diagnosed to have cataracts in at least one eye. 8.6% of the study population had undergone cataract surgery in either eye, while 4.7% had bilateral cataract surgery. 150 (4.6%) participants were diagnosed to have glaucoma, of which primary open angle glaucoma was the most common type (3.2% of the study population), followed by secondary glaucoma (0.8%) and primary angle closure glaucoma (0.2%). Pterygium was diagnosed in 508 out of 3,266 study participants, giving a prevalence rate of 15.6%. The presence of diabetic retinopathy was observed in 421 (12.9%) out of 3,265 study participants. 183 (5.6%) study participants had some degree of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), of which 23 (0.7%) were classified as having late AMD.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This paper provides a summary of the prevalence of common eye diseases among the Singaporean adult Malay population and provides data useful for public health education and disease prevention.\n"

      " Segregation of ophthalmoscopic characteristics according to choroidal thickness in patients with early age-related macular degeneration.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To investigate the association of fundus features with choroidal thickness in eyes with early age-related macular degeneration.\n",
      "METHODS: Consecutive patients with age-related macular degeneration were evaluated. Major exclusionary criteria included late age-related macular degeneration (central geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization), macular laser therapy, myopia greater than -6 diopters, past vitreoretinal surgery, or central serous chorioretinopathy. Charts and multimodal imaging were reviewed for refraction, cataract, hypertension, diabetes, open-angle glaucoma, β-zone peripapillary atrophy, fundus tessellation, pigmentary changes, drusen, subretinal drusenoid deposits (also known as reticular pseudodrusen). Data measured from enhanced-depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography included subfoveal choroidal thickness, central foveal thickness, outer nuclear layer thickness, inner segment to retinal pigment epithelium aggregate thickness, presence of subretinal drusenoid deposit, and outer retinal hyperreflective layers (including the band corresponding to overlap between retinal pigment epithelium apical processes and outer segments). Correlations were calculated among the measured variables, fundus features, open-angle glaucoma, and visual acuity.\n",
      "RESULTS: In 90 eyes of 70 early age-related macular degeneration patients with mean visual acuity 20/31 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 0.193), subfoveal choroidal thickness showed a significant inverse correlation with age (P = 0.004) and increasing myopic spherical equivalent refractive error (P = 0.023). Subfoveal choroidal thickness was thinner in eyes with fundus tessellation (P < 0.001), subretinal drusenoid deposit (P = 0.023), an absence of conventional drusen (P < 0.001), the presence of β-zone peripapillary atrophy (P < 0.001), and in eyes with a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma (P = 0.003) or an absent band on optical coherence tomography corresponding to overlap between outer segment and retinal pigment epithelium apical processes (P = 0.022).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Major ocular manifestations in early age-related macular degeneration and open-angle glaucoma are associated with the choroid-the main blood supply in the eye. Theories concerning the pathogenesis of these two diseases should incorporate interactions involving the choroid.\n"

      "METHODS: Twenty emmetropes (20) and sixty-eight myopes (68) underwent manifest refraction, A- and B-scan, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), full field ERG and MF-ERG. The amplitudes and implicit times of ERG were determined. The results were further analyzed by comparing ocular axis length, refraction, retinal thickness, and macular function detected by ERG parameters.\n",
      "RESULTS: There was a significant difference in implicit times of MF-ERG of an emmetrope and a moderate and high myopia whereas implicit times of mild myopia patients and emmetropes were similar. There was a statistically significant difference in amplitude densities of first positive peak of MF-ERG P1 wave between an emmetrope and a moderate and high myopia. In central ring and four quadrants, amplitude densities showed negative correlation to ocular axis length and diopter of myopia. There was no statistically significant difference between the average retinal thickness in emmetropic and physiological myopic eyes (low, medium, high), but there was significant difference between physiological and pathological myopia.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Decreased foveal function as determined by MF-ERG is associated with high degree of myopia. Retinal function impairment is correlated with increase in the diopter of myopia, decrease of corrected visual acuity (VA), elongation of ocular axis and increased macular degeneration.\n"

      "METHODS: The medical records of 61 consecutive patients who underwent macular translocation with 360° retinotomy for AMD (35 eyes) or mCNV (26 eyes) were reviewed. Overall, 40 patients, 17 mCNV and 23 AMD, were followed for at least 5 years. BCVA and area of the Goldmann visual field (VF) measured before, 12 months after surgery, and at the final visit.\n",
      "RESULTS: In the 23 AMD eyes followed for ≥ 5 years, the mean preoperative BCVA was 1.149 ± 0.105 logMAR units, which significantly improved to 0.69 ± 0.06 logMAR units at 1 year (P<0.001). This BCVA was maintained at 0.633 ± 0.083 logMAR units on their final examination. In the 17 eyes with mCNV followed for ≥ 5 years, the mean preoperative BCVA was 1.083 ± 0.119 logMAR units, which was significantly improved to 0.689 ± 0.121 logMAR units at 1 year (P = 0.001).

      " Recent trends in the management of maculopathy secondary to pathological myopia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Pathological myopia is a frequent cause of secondary visual disturbance in young individuals worldwide. Myopic maculopathy describes a spectrum of clinical changes that comprise the main cause of visual loss among highly myopic individuals. Our aim is to describe current trends in the medical and surgical management of maculopathy secondary to pathological myopia.\n",
      "METHODS: The epidemiology, natural history, medical and surgical treatment modalities for choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) and vitreomacular disorders secondary to pathological myopia (PM) are reviewed and evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: The medical and surgical treatment modalities in the management of myopic maculopathy have evolved over time. Laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin and other medical treatments have been superseded by the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor in the management of CNV secondary to PM. Surgical treatments are beneficial in the treatment of vitreomacular interface disorders such as macular hole retinal detachment and macular traction; however, primary success rates remain lower than those for non-myopic individuals.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This updated clinical perspective demonstrates that CNV and vitreomacular disorders in pathological myopia are treatable conditions. There are numerous medical and surgical interventions that have significantly improved the outcome of myopic maculopathy and several others currently under investigation. Nonetheless, as technology advances, further well-designed studies are necessary to establish a uniform evidence-based approach for classification and treatment.\n"

      "METHODS: In this population-based study, 3172 persons of Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnicities 40 years and older were included. Participants underwent comprehensive systemic and ocular examination, retinal photography, and laboratory investigations. Early and late AMD signs were graded from retinal photographs. Age-standardized prevalence estimates were calculated using the 2010 Singapore adult population as the standard population. Association with a range of systemic risk factors was analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of 3172 participants, AMD was present in 211 subjects. Age-standardized prevalence of AMD was 7.0% in persons 40 years and older. The age-standardized prevalence was similar in all 3 Asian ethnic groups: Chinese, 7.3%; Malay, 7.7%; and Indian, 5.7% (P value = .44). The prevalence increased with age and was higher in men. Of the range of risk factors evaluated, only myopic refractive error (<-0.5 D) was significantly associated with a lower risk for AMD (odds ratio, 0.44; P < .001, compared with emmetropia) in Chinese men.\n",

      "METHODS: The survey was done in a representative county (Yongchuan District, Chongqing Municipality) of western China. Cluster random sampling was used to select children aged 6 to 15 years. We conducted door-to-door surveys and eye examinations including optometry, stereoscopic vision test, eye position and eye movement, slit lamp examination of the anterior segment, retinoscopy, and fundus examination after cycloplegia with 1% cyclopentolate.\n",
      "RESULTS: Among 3469 children, data were available for 3079 (88.76%). The prevalences of eye diseases were, in descending order, refractive error (20.69%; 637/3079), conjunctivitis (11.76%; 362/3079), amblyopia (1.88%; 58/3079), color vision defect (0.52%; 16/3079), keratitis (0.36%; 11/3079), strabismus (0.29%; 9/3079), cataract (0.23%; 7/3079), pathologic myopia (0.19%; 6/3079), and ocular trauma (0.13%; 4/3079). The prevalence of corneal leucoma, corneal staphyloma, optic neuropathy, macular degeneration, and myelinated nerve fibers was 0.03% (1/3079) for each.

      "PURPOSE: To report the outcome of 10 patients with optic pit maculopathy (OPM) and evaluate the role of small-gauge vitrectomy, gas endotamponade, and additional laser photocoagulation treatment.\n",
      "METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 10 patients who underwent small-gauge, sutureless vitrectomy for OPM, detachment of the posterior hyaloid, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, endolaser photocoagulation on the temporal margin of the optic disc, and gas tamponade. Preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was recorded and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging was performed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Seven out of 10 patients gained at least 2 lines of vision; 2 patients gained 1 line of vision. Visual improvement occurred more than 3 months after surgery. One myopic patient developed a macular hole postoperatively, resulting in a poor functional result even though complete retinal attachment was achieved. The functional outcome did not always correlate well with the OCT imaging, in which complete retinal reattachment was observed in 5 out of 10 eyes.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic approach should include both small-gauge vitrectomy and ILM peeling to relieve vitreoretinal traction, as well as laser photocoagulation of the temporal margin of the optic disc in order to prevent vitreous fluid from entering the subretinal/intraretinal space. In addition, the patients should be told that visual recovery can take a long time.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To compare the macular choroidal thickness in 2 types of early dry-type myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "DESIGN: Prospective, observational, comparative study.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients with a refractive error of less than -8 diopters were included and were classified into 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of 24 eyes with a tessellated fundus, and group 2 consisted of 33 eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, but not to the extent of patchy chorioretinal atrophy. These 2 groups were compared with regard to their clinical characteristics, refractive error, axial length, macular choroidal thickness, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Linear regression was used to evaluate the explanatory variables in terms of macular choroidal thickness and BCVA.\n",
      "RESULTS: Patients in group 1 were significantly younger and had better BCVA, less myopia, shorter axial length, and less staphyloma than those in group 2. Refractive error, axial length, and BCVA correlated significantly with macular choroidal thickness in group 2. However, no such significant correlations were observed in group 1. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age and macular choroidal thickness were the variables that associated most strongly with BCVA, whereas neither refractive error nor axial length was a significant predictor of BCVA. In group 2, eyes with lacquer cracks showed worse BCVA and thinner macular choroidal thickness than eyes without lacquer cracks.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Macular choroidal thickness is an important factor in myopic maculopathy and can be a better indicator of its severity. These findings suggest that BCVA reduction in eyes with dry-type myopic maculopathy can be related to a thinner macular choroidal thickness and to the development of lacquer cracks.\n"

      "RESULTS: The median visual acuity for the cohort was 0.2 logMAR (range 0-3). Most patients had myopic astigmatism with the median spherical equivalent being -5.375 dioptres (-0.125 to -18.75). Fundoscopy was within normal limits in 15 eyes; there was severe myopic maculopathy in three eyes. Other secondary complications included face turn because of nystagmus and strabismic amblyopia. All patients had electronegative dark-adapted bright white flash electroretinograms (ERGs) consistent with dysfunction occurring postphototransduction. In the two oldest subjects (aged 75 and 58 years), there was additional photoreceptor dysfunction in keeping with myopic degeneration. ON-OFF ERGs showed generalized cone ON bipolar system dysfunction in all five patients tested. Pattern ERG P50 was normal (Ν = 1), subnormal (N = 2) or undetectable (N = 2). Nine mutations in GRM6 were detected in all seven families; six of these changes were novel.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype associated with GRM6 mutation is variable in terms of presentation, refractive error, visual acuity and macular function. ERGs are electronegative and suggest ON-pathway dysfunction.\n"

      "DESIGN: Prospective case series conducted at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Twelve-month follow-up data for 41 patients with CNV recruited from the outpatient clinic from May 2008 to April 2010 is presented. Fifteen patients had myopia, seven had multifocal choroiditis, and eight had other primary causes.\n",
      "METHODS: All patients had visual acuity, fluorescein angiogram and optical coherence tomography performed at the initial visit (baseline).

      "METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of 93 eyes in 93 healthy Danish university students (mean age 24.9 ± 2.6 years). The submacular choroid was imaged using enhanced-depth imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured by visual inspection and manual fitting of the choroidal borderlines. Study parameters included history, best corrected visual acuity, objective refraction, interferometric ocular axial length, fundus photography, and blood pressure manometry.\n",
      "RESULTS: The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was 342 (±118) μm, the mean age was 24.9 (±2.6) years and the mean refractive error of participants was -1.43 (±2.9) diopters (D). In a multiple regression model, subfoveal choroidal thickness decreased by 58.2 μm (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.2-74.2 μm; P < 0.001) per mm increase in axial length adjusted for age and sex and subfoveal choroidal thickness was 62 μm (95% CI, 21-104 μm; P = 0.0039) thicker in men than in women, adjusted for age and axial length. Arterial blood pressure had no statistical effect on subfoveal choroidal thickness.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this study of healthy young participants choroidal thickness was 18% higher in men than in women when adjusting for age and axial length. This observation may help explain the effect of sex in conditions related to choroidal thickness such as myopia, central serous chorioretinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.\n"

      "The pathology of the posterior pole in high myopic eyes is characterised by scleral thinning and staphyloma associated with structural changes of the retina. Epiretinal membranes and epiretinal traction together with partial separation of the ILM result in myopic foveoschisis and posterior tractional detachment with myopic macular holes. Foveal detachment and retinoschisis in highly myopic eyes may resolve after vitrectomy with ILM peeling: however, there is a considerable risk for the development of macular hole formation. Skleral buckling surgery is currently regaining interest and allows one to reduce the tractional forces in selected cases. While reading visual acuity is usually not regained after macular hole development, prophylactic measures should be considered for the fellow eye. Vitreous surgery might have a rationale as prophylactic treatment for highly myopic eyes at high risk of macular hole development; however, this needs to be weighed against possible surgical complications.\n",

      "Choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia is the most common cause of severe visual impairment in myopic patients younger than 50 years old. The typical features of myopic CNV in contrast to age-related macular degeneration as well as the anatomic characteristics have an impact on the parameters of the baseline and follow-up examinations. As the usually small fibrovascular lesions show a rapid progression in the spontaneous course of the disease and lead to irreversible damage to the photoreceptors, prompt initiation of treatment is mandatory. The superior functional results of anti-VEGF drugs provide the reason for the first-line status of this treatment modality. Increasing safety data and consistent results of prospective pilot trials have proved photodynamic therapy to be inferior. There are signs that PRN-based treatment algorithms may allow for less frequent dosing than in other retinal diseases.\n"

      "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe spectral domain optical coherence tomography characteristics and evolution of non-full-thickness macular holes, with a bed of retinal tissue present in the outer retinal layers, which the author will henceforth refer to as non-full-thickness macular holes (NFMHs).\n",
      "METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 10,239 consecutive spectral domain optical coherence tomographic examinations was conducted, to select patients with idiopathic NFMH. We measured the following parameters: visual acuity, type of NFMH, coexistence of epiretinal membranes, photoreceptor layer defects, central and maximum retinal thickness, and diameters of the fovea defect. Patients with a history of diabetes; previous vein occlusions, with age-related macular degeneration; high and medium myopia; a previous history of retinal detachment; or macular edema were excluded.\n",
      "RESULTS: Four subtypes of NFMH were distinguished among 125 eyes (116 patients): macular pseudohole (21 eyes), paralamellar macular holes (34 eyes), pseudoholes with lamellar defects (25 eyes), and lamellar macular holes (45 eyes). We observed different fovea appearances on consecutive B-scans in 54% of eyes. Epiretinal membranes coexisted in 100% of cases. Photoreceptor layer defects, seen in 29% of cases, were the most important factor correlating with visual acuity. Other factors correlating with visual acuity were maximum retinal thickness and outer diameter of the fovea defect. We noted epiretinal membranes in the second eye in 32 cases. Sixty-six patients were followed up for a mean time of 14 months. Non-full-thickness macular hole formation was documented in five cases.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Spectral domain optical coherence tomography images presented of four different morphologic types NFMH, which may change during the natural course of the disease. High resolution of spectral domain optical coherence tomography enabled the visualization of photoreceptor defects, a feature not previously described. Moreover, epiretinal membranes and fovea contour localized beneath the outer plexiform layer were noted in all cases.\n",

      "DESIGN: Nonrandomized, retrospective, interventional case series.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed a chart review of consecutive patients who underwent vitreoretinal surgery for myopic traction maculopathy by a single surgeon at a tertiary referral center. Traction mechanisms were identified based on preoperative and intraoperative findings and postoperative response to a tailored surgical approach.\n",
      "RESULTS: Six eyes of 6 patients with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were included. Major pathogenic traction mechanisms included perifoveal posterior vitreous detachment with vitreomacular traction in 3 eyes, noncompliance of native internal limiting membrane in 2 eyes, epiretinal membrane in 1 eye, and remnant cortical vitreous layer after posterior vitreous detachment in 1 eye. One eye exhibited 2 traction mechanisms. The surgical approach addressed only the major traction mechanism(s) identified in each eye. After surgery, the visual acuity improved by 2 lines or more in all eyes, and macular thickening resolved completely in 5 (83%) of 6 eyes and partially in the remaining eye.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The traction mechanisms causing myopic traction maculopathy are diverse. Vitreoretinal surgical repair for this condition is successful when the major traction mechanisms causing tautness of the inner retina are identified and relieved.\n"

      " Emerging nonsurgical methods for the treatment of vitreomacular adhesion: a review.\n",
      "With the dissemination of optical coherence tomography over the past two decades, the role of persistent vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) in the development of numerous macular pathologies - including idiopathic macular hole, vitreomacular traction syndrome, cystoid and diabetic macular edema, neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion, exudative age-related macular degeneration, and myopic traction maculopathy - has been established. While invasive vitreoretinal procedures have long been utilized to address complications related to these disorders, such an approach is hampered by incomplete vitreoretinal separation and vitreous removal, surgical complications, and high costs. In light of such limitations, investigators have increasingly looked to nonsurgical means for the treatment of persistent pathologic VMA. Chief among these alternative measures is the intravitreal application of pharmacologic agents for the induction of vitreous liquefaction and/or vitreoretinal separation, an approach termed pharmacologic vitreolysis. This article aims to review the available evidence regarding the use of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of VMA-related pathology. In addition, a discussion of vitreous molecular organization and principles of physiologic posterior vitreous detachment is provided to allow for a consideration of vitreolytic agent mode of action and molecular targets.\n",

      "RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-one patients (443 eyes) presented with maculopathy in this study. The most common subtype of high myopic maculopathy was lacquer cracks (prevalence 29.1%). The most commonly observed degree was M(3) (choroidal pallor and tessellation, with posterior staphyloma and lacquer cracks). Older age was significantly associated with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (p = 0.024), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (p < 0.001), choroidal neovascularisation (CNV, p < 0.001) and macular atrophy (p = 0.002). Younger age was associated with lacquer cracks (p < 0.001). A higher degree of myopia was a risk factor for almost all kinds of maculopathy: tessellated fundus (p = 0.001), lacquer cracks (p < 0.001), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (p < 0.001), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (p = 0.025) and macular atrophy p < 0.001), whereas a lower degree of myopia was associated with CNV (p = 0.001). A worse visual acuity was associated with lacquer cracks (p = 0.001), macular atrophy (p < 0.001) and CNV p < 0.001), while better visual acuity was associated with tessellated fundus (p < 0.001) and diffuse atrophy (p = 0.002). Older age (p < 0.001), more myopic refractive error (p < 0.001) and worse visual acuity (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with a greater severity of maculopathy. There was no gender difference in the type and severity of myopic maculopathy.\n",

      "This paper presents the case of a 47-year-old female with low vision secondary to high myopic macular degeneration who remains active in the work force as a spiritual and religious care coordinator for a large institution. An ophthalmologist with a specialty in low vision rehabilitation initially assessed the client. The ophthalmologist prescribed optical devices which used residual retinal vision available at preferred retinal loci. This availed better vision for viewing targets located at far, near and intermediate distances from the client. An optician provided and dispensed the devices prescribed to the client. Additionally, the ophthalmologist made a referral to an occupational therapist. The occupational therapist conducted a series of sessions to further enhance reading and writing skills and a work place assessment aimed at optimizing workplace conditions in order to achieve optimal functional vision. This case illustrates and emphasizes the multi-disciplinary nature of low vision rehabilitation, which involved in this case co-operation between ophthalmology, occupational therapy and opticianry.\n",

      " Ability to determine postoperative status of macular hole in gas-filled eyes by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To determine whether the status of a macular hole can be determined by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in gas-filled eyes.\n",
      "DESIGN: Prospective study, university hospital setting.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six eyes with a macular hole, seven eyes with a macular hole retinal detachment and four eyes with a macular hole and myopic traction maculopathy underwent vitreous surgery.\n",
      "METHODS: The macular area was examined by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT-4000) on postoperative days 1, 3, 7 and 30.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of macular hole closure.\n",
      "RESULTS: The status of macular hole was able to be assessed in 24 eyes (92%) on postoperative day 1 and 23 were closed. The condition of the macular hole could not be determined in the other two eyes with a lower volume of gas (≤60%). The macular hole of seven eyes could be seen only when the patients looked upward or downward (P = 0.009). The 11 eyes with a macular hole retinal detachment or a myopic traction maculopathy had a posterior staphyloma, and the macular hole was visible in four eyes on day 1 (P = 0.001). When a closure of the macular hole was detected on day 1, the macular hole remained closed in all of these eyes on day 30.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The status of a macular hole can be determined by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on postoperative day 1 even in gas-filled eyes. The visibility depends on the volume of intravitreal gas and the absence of a posterior staphyloma.\n"

      " Prevalence and causes of visual impairment and blindness in an urban Indian population: the Singapore Indian Eye Study.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To describe the prevalence and causes of visual impairment and blindness in an urban Indian population.\n",
      "DESIGN: Population-based study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS: Ethnic Indians aged more than 40 years living in Singapore.\n",
      "METHODS: Participants underwent standardized ophthalmic assessments for visual impairment and blindness, defined using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and presenting visual acuity (PVA), according to US and modified World Health Organization (WHO) definitions.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unilateral visual impairment or blindness was defined on the basis of the worse eye, and bilateral visual impairment or blindness was defined on the basis of the better eye. Primary causes of visual impairment were determined.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 3400 eligible individuals (75.6% response rate) participated. On the basis of US definitions, the age-standardized prevalence was 0.4% for bilateral blindness (≤20/200, better eye) and 3.4% for bilateral visual impairment (<20/40 to >20/200, better eye). Another 0.3% of bilateral blindness and 13.4% of bilateral visual impairment were correctable with refraction. Cataract was the principal cause of best-corrected bilateral blindness (60.0%) and bilateral visual impairment (65.7%). Other major causes of blindness and visual impairment included diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, corneal opacity, and myopic maculopathy.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of bilateral blindness and visual impairment in Indians living in Singapore is lower than estimates from populations living in India, but similar to estimates obtained from Singapore Malay and Chinese populations. Cataract is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment. One in 20 cases of bilateral blindness and 1 in 10 cases of bilateral visual impairment are attributable to diabetic retinopathy. These data may have relevance to many ethnic Indian persons living outside India.\n"

      " Optimising the management of choroidal neovascularisation in Asian patients: consensus on treatment recommendations for anti-VEGF therapy.\n",
      "In Asian countries, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), specifically wet AMD or choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), is an important cause of blindness and visual handicap. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) play an integral role in the development of CNV and thus provide an important therapeutic target. Current treatment paradigms for neovascular AMD recognise the place of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the management of this condition. However, combination therapy targeting different pathways to produce a synergistic effect may result in improved visual outcomes and reduced duration of treatment. Anti-VEGF therapy has greatly improved treatment outcomes in patients with CNV, and a growing body of evidence supports the role of these agents as monotherapy or in combination with PDT. In particular, anti-VEGF may be a first-line treatment option in certain types of subfoveal myopic CNV as well as for classic and occult juxtafoveal and subfoveal CNV. The implementation of evidence-based medicine into current clinical practice is paramount to improving patient care. The authors, who are also members of the Singapore Medical Retina Advisory Board, outline the consensus points and recommended treatment algorithms based on currently available knowledge to provide a structured management approach to the treatment of Asian patients with CNV.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Registered data can provide valuable information regarding blindness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the main causes and 3-year incidence of registered blindness in Jing-An district in Shanghai, China.\n",
      "METHODS: Data from the blindness registry (age, gender and cause of visual disability) were collected and analyzed. The prevalence of blindness for 2003, 2007, 2009 and the 3-year incidence of blindness were calculated.\n",
      "RESULTS: The reported blindness increased significantly from 113.7 per 100,000 in 2003 to 145.8 per 100,000 in 2006 to 165.9 per 100,000 in 2009 (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, respectively). Age significantly affects prevalence; the odd ratios (OR) were 2.57 in the 30 y - 49 y range (P < 0.001), 7.27 in the 50 y - 69 y range (P < 0.001) and 21.2 in the ≥ 70 y (P < 0.001).

      " In vivo measurement of regional variation in anterior scleral resistance to Schiotz indentation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Recent studies indicate that ocular and scleral rigidity is pertinent to our understanding of glaucoma, age related macular degeneration and the development and pathogenesis of myopia. The principal method of measuring ocular rigidity is by extrapolation of data from corneal indentation tonometry (K(o) ) using Friedenwald's transformation algorithms. Using scleral indentation (Schiotz tonometry) we assess whether regional variations in resistance to indentation occur in vivo across the human anterior globe directly, with reference to the deflection of Schiotz scale readings.\n",
      "METHODS: Data were collected from both eyes of 26 normal young adult subjects with a range of refractive error (mean spherical equivalent ± S.D. of -1.77 D ± 3.28 D, range -10.56 to +4.38 D). Schiotz tonometry (5.5 g & 7.5 g) was performed on the cornea and four scleral quadrants; supero-temporal (ST) and -nasal (SN), infero-temporal (IT) and -nasal (IN) approximately 8 mm posterior to the limbus.\n",
      "RESULTS: Values of K(o) (mm(3) )(-1) were consistent with those previously reported (mean 0.0101 ± 0.0082, range 0.0019-0.0304). In regards to the sclera, significant differences (p < 0.001) were found across quadrants with indentation readings for both loads between means for the cornea and ST; ST and SN; ST and IT, ST and IN. Mean (±S.D.) scale readings for 5.5 g were: cornea 5.93 ± 1.14, ST 8.05 ± 1.58, IT 7.03 ± 1.86, SN 6.25 ± 1.10, IN 6.02 ± 1.49; and 7.5 g: cornea 9.26 ± 1.27, ST 11.56 ± 1.65, IT 10.31 ± 1.74, SN 9.91 ± 1.20, IN 9.50 ± 1.56.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of macular translocation surgery 360 in blinding submacular diseases other than age-related macular degeneration.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective, consecutive case review was performed of subjects treated with macular translocation surgery 360 for a submacular disease other than age-related macular degeneration. Primary outcome was change in visual acuity. Clinical data were collected and analyzed, including demographics, visual acuity, imaging features, surgery details, and complications.\n",
      "RESULTS: The review identified 16 subjects who had undergone macular translocation surgery 360 from 1996 to 2009 for submacular diseases other than age-related macular degeneration. These diseases included Best disease (n = 2), angioid streaks (n = 1), pathologic myopia (n = 3), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 2), presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (n = 3), central serous chorioretinopathy (n = 1), adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (n = 3), and North Carolina macular dystrophy (n = 1). Mean preop visual acuity was 20/135 (range, 20/50-20/500). A ≤ 3-line acuity loss was seen in 13 of 16 (81%) subjects. Mean postop visual acuity was 20/110 (range, 20/40-20/1,000). The most common postop complications included epiretinal membrane (50%), cystoid macular edema (31%), residual diplopia (25%), retinal detachment (13%), and recurrent choroidal neovascularization (13%). Mean follow-up was 28 months (range, 4-61 months).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Macular translocation surgery 360 may be considered in subjects with progressive bilateral vision loss from various conditions other than age-related macular degeneration. Although a significant number of complications occurred, a large percentage of subjects gained >3 lines of visual acuity (38%) and achieved a final visual acuity of ≥ 20/50 (31%).\n"

      " [Results of ranibizumab treatment for choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia].\n",
      "PURPOSE: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathological myopia (PM) occurs in up to 10 % of PM and the natural course often leads to a considerable deterioration of visual acuity. Treatment options like laser or PDT can stabilize visual acuity. Alternatives like ranibizumab are new treatment options that show very promising results. It was the aim of this analysis to evaluate the development of visual acuity and the number of injections needed in patients with myopia-associated secondary CNVs.\n",
      "METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 10 eyes of 9 patients (7 women, 2 men, mean age: 66 years, SD 8.3; range: 54 - 78 years) treated with ranibizumab because of CNV secondary to PM. All eyes were treatment naïve. Criteria for re-treatment were loss of visual acuity and/ or activity in OCT or fluorescence angiography.\n",
      "RESULTS: During the mean follow-up of 10 months (SD 6.1; range: 6 to 26 months) a mean of 2.5 (SD 1.6, range: 1 to 5) injections of ranibizumab was applied. The spherical equivalent was - 12 D (SD 4.8, range - 7,5 D to - 20.5 D). Previous to the first injection mean visual acuity was logMAR 0,64 (SD 0.20) (ETDRS: 52.8; SD: 11.4) and during the follow-up a mean of 3.4 lines (ETDRS: 16.5 letters) was gained (p = 0.008). After one month visual acuity improved to log MAR 0.47 (SD 0.1, p = 0.0012) (ETDRS: 61.7; SD: 6.5), after 3 months log MAR 0.38 (SD 0.1, p = 0.012) (ETDRS: 65.8; SD: 5.6) and after 6 months up to log MAR 0.35 (SD 0.1, p = 0.008) (ETDRS 67.3; SD 5.6). At the end of the follow-up visual acuity was log MAR 0.30 (SD 0.1) (ETDRS: 69.3; SD: 6.7).No patient experienced a loss of visual acuity. No ocular or systemic side effects were observed.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: According to our results treatment of CNV secondary to PM with ranibizumab leads to a substantial improvement of visual acuity. It seems that successful treatment of CNV secondary to PM needs less anti-VEGF injections than the treatment of neovascularizations due to age-related macular degeneration. Anti-VEGF seems to be a promising alternative to PDT and laser photocoagulation in myopia-related CNV.\n"

      " [Pathophysiology of macular diseases--morphology and function].\n",
      "Ophthalmic fundus imaging plays an important role in the advances in the pathophysiology of retinal diseases. Using fundus imaging, we studied morphological changes in the choroid, subretinal pathophysiology and photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell damage, and functional abnormalities of photoreceptor cells in macular diseases. To evaluate the choroidal changes, we performed enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) for macular diseases. Choroidal thickness both in the affected eyes and in the fellow eyes with choroidal vascular hyperpermeability was thicker in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) reduced the hyperpermeability and led to choroidal thinning in eyes with CSC, whereas laser photocoagulation did not result in any change in choroidal thickness, suggesting different mechanism of action for these two forms of treatment. PDT also decreased choroidal thickness in eyes with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. These findings will help to elucidate the pathophysiologic features of CSC as well as responses to treatment. Patients with acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease have markedly thickened choroids. Both the choroidal thickness and the retinal detachment in these patients decreased quickly with corticosteroid treatment. EDI-OCT can be used to evaluate the choroidal involvement in VKH disease in acute stages and may prove useful in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Dome-shaped macula is the result of a localized thickening of the sclera under the macula in highly myopic patients, and it cannot be categorized into any known type of staphyloma. EDI-OCT is helpful in monitoring the proposed site of pathophysiologic changes in the choroid and the sclera, and provides noninvasively information not available by other means. To clarify the subretinal changes and the mechanism of cell damage in macular detachment, we studied the clinical characteristics of yellow deposits (multiple dot-like yellow precipitates and subretinal yellow material) seen in CSC using fundus autofluorescence and OCT. The yellow deposits had highly reflective tissue in the intraretinal and subretinal spaces seen on OCT and hyperfluorescence on short-wave autofluorescence (SW-AF) examinations during the follow-up period. These findings may indicate that formations of yellow deposits are associated with the accumulation of the photoreceptor outer segments and metabolism and phagocytosis by macrophages or RPE cells. SW-AF also demonstrated a hypofluorescence corresponding to the accumulated areas of yellow deposits during the long term followup period. Another study using infrared autofluorescence examination demonstrated that the yellow deposits induced a decrease in melanin and the functional decline of RPE cells in CSC. These may indicate that the existence of depositions in eyes with CSC is associated with photoreceptor and RPE cells damage. Similar yellow deposits can also be seen in eyes with macular detachment, e. g. branch retinal vein occlusion. We report a new method of retinal densitometry using SW-AF examination by scanning laser ophthalmoscope. We named the technique autofluorescence densitometry (AFD). This technique can evaluate photopigment density from serial SW-AF images during exposure to excitation light. This new technique can examine a much broader macular area and create a distribution map of optical density of the photopigments. It is also easy to compare the distribution of the photopigment densities with other retinal imaging devices such as OCT. To investigate functional abnormalities in eyes with CSC, we measured the optical density of the photopigments using AFD in both the acute and quiescent phase. The photopigment density decreased at the serous retinal detachment. The density remained decreased immediately after resolution and showed delayed recovery. The photopigments decreased even in eyes with a morphologic recovery of the outer retina. AFD could identify the functional impairment of the outer retina as characterized by changes in the photopigments.\n"

      "PURPOSE: To compare the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) findings of the acute lesions of multifocal choroiditis (MFC) with those of new-onset myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV).\n",
      "METHODS: Observational case series. A retrospective review comparing the SD-OCT findings of the acute lesions of MFC with those of early myopic CNV. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography findings in two female patients and one male patient presenting with acute inflammatory lesions of MFC were compared with those of new-onset CNV in three patients with myopic macular degeneration. Each patient underwent a comprehensive eye examination, fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography on the initial visit. The patients underwent SD-OCT scanning at baseline and at follow-up visits using image registration and eye tracking.\n",
      "RESULTS: Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging of the acute lesions of MFC showed drusenlike material between the retinal pigment epithelium and the Bruch membrane, presumed vitreous cells, and localized choroidal hyperreflectivity below the subretinal pigment epithelial material. These SD-OCT findings were not usually present in the eyes with myopic CNV. The subretinal pigment epithelial material corresponded to acute lesions found on color photographs and fluorescein angiography. The subretinal pigment epithelial material and choroidal hyperreflectivity appeared to improve after treatment with antiinflammatory or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. In contrast, SD-OCT in the patients with myopic CNV showed a very thin choroid, a posterior staphyloma, and a Type 2 (subretinal) neovascular pattern.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The acute lesions of MFC can be difficult to distinguish from myopic CNV based on clinical examination and fluorescein angiography. However, the inflammatory lesions of MFC can demonstrate characteristic SD-OCT findings not seen with myopic CNV. These SD-OCT findings may help to differentiate these two entities that typically require different treatments.\n"

All those children, aged 4-16 years, who had corrected visual acuity (VA) less than 6/18 in the better eye after medical or surgical treatment, were included in the study. WHO low vision criteria were used to classify into visually impaired, severe visually impaired and blind. Results were described as percentage frequencies.\n",
      "RESULTS: One hundred and eighty nine (70%) were males and 81 (30%) were females. The male to female ratio was 2.3:1. The main causes of visual impairment included nystagmus (15%), Stargardt's disease (14%), maculopathies (13%), myopic macular degeneration (11%) and oculocutaneous albinism (7%). The percentages of visually impaired, severe visually impaired and blind were 33.8%, 27.2% and 39.0% respectively.

      " Myopic choroidal neovascularization treated by intravitreal bevacizumab: comparison of two different initial doses.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Myopic maculopathy is the leading cause of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients under 50 years of age. New antiangiogenic drugs are being used off-label with varied therapeutic schedules to treat CNV. The aim of this study is to report the anatomical and visual outcomes of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treated by two different schedules with intravitreal bevacizumab.\n",
      "METHODS: Prospective, comparative, consecutive, non-randomized, multicentric, interventional pilot study. Two groups of highly myopic patients with subfoveal and juxtafoveal CNV were treated by monthly intravitreal injections with 1.25 mg bevacizumab. Group 1 comprised 19 eyes treated by three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections. Group 2 comprised 20 eyes treated by one single intravitreal injection. Patients were evaluated for best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline and then monthly. Fluorescein angiography was performed at baseline and when CNV activity was suspected. Further intravitreal injections were performed if CNV activity was detected.\n",
      "RESULTS: Both groups were matched for age, spherical equivalent, LogMAR BCVA, and central foveal thickness (CFT) as determined by OCT at baseline and number of eyes with previous PDT treatment. The average number of letters gained was 6.3 in group 1 vs 7.2 in group 2 (p = 0.001 and 0.09 respectively, Student's t-test for paired data). Changes in OCT were not significant for either group by the end of follow-up. The mean number injections performed was 3.2 in group 1 vs 1.7 in group 2 (p = 0.00, Mann-Whitney test). Four recurrences (four eyes) occurred in group 1 vs 15 (seven eyes) in group 2 (p = 0.001; Fisher's exact test).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Both schedules achieved similar results improving BCVA, though the second group required a lower number of injections, showing a higher rate of recurrences during the first year.\n"

      " Comparative evaluation of anatomical and functional outcomes using brilliant blue G versus triamcinolone assisted ILM peeling in macular hole surgery in Indian population.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To compare anatomical and functional outcomes using brilliant blue G (BBG) vs triamcinolone acetonide (TA)-assisted ILM peeling in macular hole surgery (MHS).\n",
      "STUDY DESIGN: Simple, comparative, retrospective, non-randomised, interventional single-centre study.\n",
      "METHODS: Ninety-four eyes of 94 patients with idiopathic macular holes (≥ stage 2) who underwent MHS at our centre were included. Patients with failed macular holes, post-traumatic macular holes, history of previous vitreoretinal surgery, high myopia (6 dioptres or more) or any other macular pathology potentially limiting visual acuity, such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration, were excluded. An OCT evaluation of hole status was followed by pars plana vitrectomy for each of these eyes. Those who underwent TA-assisted ILM peeling were considered as group 1 and those with BBG-assisted ILM peeling were considered as group 2. Primary outcome measures included anatomical hole closure and functional success in terms of change in visual acuity of ≥2 LogMAR lines. Various preoperative factors were also evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS: Anatomical hole closure was achieved in 85 eyes (90.43%) and visual gain in 78 eyes (82.9%). Mean postoperative follow-up duration was 16.14 ± 1.95 months. No significant difference was found in anatomical and functional success between the two groups. Group 1 had a significantly higher incidence of postoperative glaucoma. Duration of symptoms of <12 months (p = 0.004) and preoperative visual acuity ≤1.0 LogMAR were related to anatomical success. However, greater visual gain was found in patients with chronic holes (≥12 months) (p = 0.046) and poor preoperative visual acuity (>1.0 LogMAR) (p = 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: BBG-assisted ILM peeling offers an effective alternative to triamcinolone, with the added advantage of marked enhancement of vitreoretinal interface contrast with comparable hole closure rates and visual outcomes.\n"
